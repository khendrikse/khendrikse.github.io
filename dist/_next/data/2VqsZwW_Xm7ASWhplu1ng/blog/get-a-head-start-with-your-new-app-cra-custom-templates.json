You run one script and it creates a functioning React app that you can start working on. With Custom Templates things have become even easier. In this post, we're going to discover what goes into creating a custom template."},"markdownBody":"\nCustom templates became available with `react-scripts@3.3.0`. They make it possible to predefine exactly what you want CRA's output to be. For example, maybe you want a few basic components ready, have some dependencies or scripts pre-installed in your `package.json` or add some config files for ESlint or Prettier.\n\n## CRA Templates dissected\n\nTemplates are nothing more than npm packages exporting specific configuration options for CRA + an example of what the generated app should look like.\n\nI'm going to dive a little deeper into [the example](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/) from CRA's documentation.\n\nWhen we look at the folder structure of a custom template, it looks something like this:\n\n```\nmy-cra-template\n├── README.md // the readme of the custom template package itself\n├── template.json // more on this file later\n├── package.json // the package.json for the custom template package itself\n└── template //more on this folder later\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── gitignore\n    └── public\n       └── index.html\n    └── src\n       └── index.js (or index.tsx)\n```\n\nThe `my-cra-template` folder contains a `README.md`, `template.json` and `package.json`. These all belong specifically to the CRA template package that you are trying to make. The `README.md` contains info about the package and the `package.json` has package info for npm. You can put whatever you want in your `package.json`, just make sure your package's name starts with `cra-template-...`.\n\n## What creates the template\nThe `template.json` file and the `template` folder are the pieces that actually tell CRA what to generate:\n\nThe `template.json` file is the place where we define the following:\n* **Dependencies** - the dependencies you want CRA to install in any new app.\n* **Scripts** - any scripts that you want CRA to put in the `package.json` file of any new app it creates with this template.\n\nFor now, it is not yet possible to add any `devDependencies` to the template. To make it easy for the user to add those, you can always specify them inside your package's readme so they can copy and paste it quickly.\n\nThe `template` folder essentially holds an example of how you want the generated app to look like. An easy way to create it is by creating a new app with CRA, modify it exactly the way you like. You could add some configuration files (like .eslintrc for example) or specify a folder structure with files. Then copy it into the `templates` and inside that folder:\n\n* turn `.gitignore` into `gitignore`\n* remove the `package.json` and lockfile\n* customize how you would like the generated app's `README.md` to look like.\n\nMake sure you at least have the minimum files inside your `templates` folder that the [CRA documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/) specifies.\n\nLike mentioned above; CRA has two default templates that you can look into to understand how it works:\n\n* [cra-template-typescript](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template-typescript)\n* [cra-template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template)\n\nAnd that's it!
