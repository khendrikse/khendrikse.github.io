One of the things I really had to learn is that the basics are always the right priority to dive into. It does not matter what career goal you have, be it frontend, backend or anything in between or beyond. Understanding HTML, CSS and one of the many amazing programming language out there will be a good start to your career.\n\n## Which language to choose?\n\nThat depends on your own personal context. If you already landed a job and are expected to learn a specific language for it: choose that one. If you feel excited for another: go for the other one. When self-learning the key thing is motivation. Work with what makes you excited. Once you learn one language, the others can easily follow. Don’t feel rushed or pressured into something that does not ‘spark joy’.\n\nI started my journey through the RailsGirls community. So it felt right for me to follow some Ruby courses because I already knew people who could help me a little and it was the only language I had already seen. When I got hired as a frontend developer I picked up learning JavaScript. It was fun to see how some stuff was the same, and where the two languages differed. Again: once you know one language, others can easily follow.\n\n## You don’t know what you do not know\n\nOne of the reasons it is so hard when you are a beginner in tech is because you probably don’t know the gaps in your knowledge. Having a mentor, or knowing people who have more experience to help point into the right direction can be of huge help here. Luckily I was surrounded by an amazing group of people to point me into the right direction. Still, I was craving some more structure to help me set priorities when it came to learning the essentials.\n\n## Roadmap.sh\nThrough some luck I found [Kamran Ahmed’s](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) roadmap.sh. I checked out the frontend roadmap and was amazed at the way it helped me gain insight into things I did not know I could dive into. This is how I implemented it into my own learning:\n\n1. I created a markdown file and wrote down the list of things I wanted to learn using the roadmap.\n2. I went through the list and marked the ones that motivated me to learn, and the ones I knew could help me build the projects I was working on. I gave those extra priority.\n3. I went through the list again and for each topic I started searching the web for good resources that I could study to learn that subject matter. I did not study them immediately. I was just collecting and linking to those resources in the file. (Note: nowadays roadmap.sh has [some nice resources](https://roadmap.sh/guides) themselves for some subjects, make sure to check them out!).\n4. Every quarter I chose some subjects and studied the resources.\n5. When a subject was done, I had the satisfaction of checking the checkbox in front of it ✨\n\n## Projects will kickstart your career\nLast but not least: I noticed that through work and building personal projects, I was already able to check off some of the boxes on my list. Working on actual projects actually helps you learn so much quicker than doing courses, reading articles, books or watching videos. If you haven’t tried building something yourself yet: go for it! Find something that you think would be fun to build. Maybe try using a fun API that is available on the web. Like [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/), [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) or the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). It might feel daunting to start, but if you split up the project in small tasks it will become much easier.\n\n\nGood luck for all of you out there starting on your journeys. Don’t forget that the only person you should compare yourself with, is yourself. And every new thing you learn is one more thing you did not know before. Be nice to yourself and others, and build fun stuff.\n","slug":"using-roadmapsh-for-structured-self-learning"},{"layout":"post","title":"Test global npm packages in a quick and easy way","published":true,"oldBlog":true,"date":"2020-06-16","description":"A quick guide on testing out local global npm packages line using npm or yarn.","intro":"You might already be used to creating symlinks between projects locally using yarn or npm.

You want to make changes in your component library and test them out in your React app without first having to deploy the entire package right? Let’s talk about how you can actually do this. Please don’t forget: the React app and component library are examples. You can do this with any project.\n\n### 1. Making your package available\n\nFirst we need to make the package (in our example a component library) available in your local system by going into its folder using your terminal and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link\n\n# npm\nnpm link\n```\n\n\n**What does this do?**\n\nThis command creates a symlink to our package in a specific location. You can see them in the location by going to the location:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\ncd ~/.config/yarn/link\n\n# npm\n# first figure out where your npm packages are saved by running\n\nnpm config ls -l\n\n# find the ‘prefix’ key\n# you can find where your packages are saved in\n\ncd {prefix}/lib/node_modules\n```\n\nThen run `ls` to see a list of all the packages that are installed.\n\n\n\u003e **You keep talking about symlinks. What are those?**\n\u003e A symlink (or ‘symbolic link’) is a file that has a reference to another file. You can also explain it as being a file that points to another file, or you can see it as a ‘shortcut’ on your computer.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhen you create a symlink you are telling your computer to create a link to file A. This link is saved in file B. When we want to use file B, we are essentially using file A.\n\n### 2. Linking to your package\n\nWe now go to the project where you want to use the package (in our example the React app). In here we run\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nyarn link “catpaws”\n\n# npm\nnpm link \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nnpm link “catpaws”\n```\n\nAwesome.\n\nYour project now has its package linked locally so you can test everything out. Are you done testing? Then make sure to unlink the package in your project folder by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink \u003cpackage name\u003e\n```\n\nAnd remove the package from the symlinks list by going to the folder of your package and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink\n```\n\n\n## How to link to your package globally?\n\nSo it’s all great to know how to create local links between projects, but how about when you don’t have a project, but your computer that needs to globally link to your local package? Well, it’s actually a bit different, but still super easy. First, let’s check which packages you already have installed globally by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn global list\n\n# yarn\nnpm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true\n```\n\nYou should get a nice overview of stuff that is already installed.\n\n### 1. Link to your package.\n\n**yarn**\nIn your terminal, run `yarn global add /full/path/to/package`.\nIf we now run `yarn global list` again, we should see the name of our package in the list.\n\nIf you want to remove it you simply run `yarn global remove “package name”`.\n\nNow there is a tricky part here. Yarn does not fully seem to support globally linking to local packages yet so the way we do this is actually a bit hacky. You see, yarn does not automatically update the package you have added, so for each change you want to test, you have to add it again...\n\nIt's easier with npm:\n\n**npm**\nWith npm it it the same as before, but we just go to the folder of our package and run `npm link`.\n\nIf you now run `npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true` you’ll see that your package is in the list.\n\nYou remove it from the list by going into the package folder and running `npm unlink`.\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing either yarn or npm, once you know how, it can be easy to create symlinks to test any package between projects, or in global mode. Right now, npm seems to have the easiest workflow.\n\nI got stuck the first time I had to develop something that I wanted to test globally and it took me some time to figure out how to make this work. I hope this helps others who might encounter the same problem. If you have any other way to do this please share them in the comments so we can all learn from it 👍.\n","slug":"Test-global-npm-packages-in-a-quick-and-easy-way"},{"layout":"post","title":"The basics of a function, illustrated! ✨","published":true,"oldBlog":true,"date":"2020-05-21","description":"Learn about JavaScript functions with a simple metaphor.","intro":"One thing that can be difficult to understand when you just start out learning how to program is what a function is and how it works. As a beginner developer, it can be especially difficult to understand what arguments are and where they come from. This blog illustrates how a  javascript function works in its most basic form.","tags":"beginner, javascript, codenewbie","cover_image":"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/tri97q55qgtexhhakgxe.png","cover_image_alt":"illustration of an abstract factory","markdownBody":"\n## What is a function\n\n*Functions are like small programs that are built to do a specific task.* We first create (or 'declare') this program (which we will from now on call a function). Once we are done writing it, we can start using (or 'execute') it.\n\nIt’s kind of like building a small factory. While setting up the factory we create a building. Inside this building, we set everything in place so the factory can receive whatever raw materials it needs and return whatever product we want as output.\n\nLet’s say we want to build a factory that takes any number and adds two. From the inside the factory would look something like this:\n\n![a factory that takes in a number and returns that number plus two](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9onjc8zt7vpuommno32w.png)\n\nWe can see that the factory is expecting to get any type of number as input. Because we don’t know yet which number it might receive, we’ll just call whatever input we get `num` for ‘number’. Inside the factory, we add 2 to whatever we got as input. It then returns the output which is the combination of `num + 2`.\n\n\u003e### About `num`\n\u003e`num` is just a representation, or container, for what we get as input. We can even rename it into whatever we want. If we were making a factory that added two apples to a number of bananas, we could rename `num` to `bananas`. The input would be a number of bananas, the output would be a number of bananas plus two apples.\n\nDo you see that we also gave the factory a name? `plusTwo`. This makes it a bit easier for when we want to refer to the factory. This way we can tell our workers: ‘I want you to use the factory `plusTwo` to process a specific number and add 2’.\n\nOur factory is ready to be used now. To use it we need to provide a number as input. Let’s say we want to give it a `3` as input. We can’t see what is happening inside the factory but we can see what is returned from the factory: it’s a 5 (3 + 2 = 5):\n\n![The outside of a factory that takes in 3 and returns 5](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o65pxtvzpgwjbkccobaa.png)\n\n## Let’s get coding\n\nFunctions essentially work the same way. Instead of building an imaginary factory, let’s actually start creating a function in JavaScript.\n\nWe first set up the function, these are like the walls of the factory. For convenience, we will also give the function a name, just like we did with the factory. We’ll call it `plusTwo`.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo( ) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe are then going to define what we are expecting the program to get as input. We call these `arguments` or `parameters`. In this case, we are expecting to get one number. And because it can be any type of number, we’re going to give it a more generic name like `num`. We will define this argument within the two parentheses `()`. Look at it as the door that allows our input arguments to enter the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe’ll now finish the function by saying exactly what it needs to do and return. It needs to return the sum of `num` and 2. This will become the output of the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n    return num + 2;\n}\n\n```\n\nNow the function is ready to be used. It knows what it is going to get as input, and what it needs to return as output. The part where we use the word `return` is actually really important. This tells the function to `return` our output.\n\nOtherwise, it is kind of like closing the output door to our factory: the produced results cannot leave the factory:\n\n![The factory output door is closed and none of the product can get out](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/b77bysgp94758d7vx8ul.png)\n\n\u003e### Again, what is `num`?\n\u003eWe can rename `num` into whatever we like. It is just a name that we make up to define whatever enters our function. For example, the following two functions would have the exact same result:\n\n```js\nfunction plusTwo(x) {\n    return x + 2;\n}\n\nfunction plusTwoApples(numberOfApples) {\n    return numberOfApples + 2;\n}\n```\n\n\u003e`x` and `numberOfApples` are simply names we give whatever arguments we are going to get. While we could use `x` as a name for our arguments, it does not tell us a lot about what we are getting. This is why we try to give it a more descriptive name.\n\nFrom now on, if you want to code along, you can actually [open developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on this page and first type the function that we made just now, press return on your keyboard, and follow along for the next part.\n\n## Start using the function\n\nWe can now actually start using the function. Remember that we gave both the factory and the function a name? Just like with the factory, we can now tell our workers (in this case, our program) to use the function `plusTwo` to process a number and add 2’.\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(3) // returns 5\n\n```\n\nWe pass the number 3 into the doors that are our parentheses. In the function, this means that `num` now is a representation of 3. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 3.\n\nIf we pass 5, it will return 7:\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(5) // returns 7\n\n```\n\nAgain, in our function `num` now is a representation of 5. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 5.\n\nAnd that’s it! There is a lot more to learn about functions, but these are the basics that should help you get on your way! I hope it helps anyone learning this for the first time to understand the concepts a bit more.\n\n\n\n","slug":"The-basics-of-a-function-illustrated"},{"layout":"post","title":"Coding with a group of 11 year olds","published":true,"oldBlog":true,"date":"2019-10-07","description":"Get them 'hacking' their favourite websites","tags":"beginner, teaching, tutorial, programming","intro":"Recently a we were asked if we could give a short lesson about coding to a group of 11 year olds in primary school. So my colleague and me started preparing a 1,5 hour workshop with the goal of showing the kids how much fun programming could be. This is the story of how it went.","cover_image":"https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lZlI5EjpMCaVdC/giphy.gif","cover_image_alt":"a cute moving image with a keyboard and cartoon cats going up and down","markdownBody":"\n## Get to know what they love\nOur goal was to stay as close to their own interests as possible. So with a little bit of research we discovered that these kids really loved to use mobile phones and consoles outside of school. Generally most of them knew and used apps like TikTok, SnapChat and WhatsApp, they regularly visited YouTube for watching videos and some of the kids played Minecraft or Fortnite at home.\n\n## Make it interactive\nTo keep them engaged we used [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). We wanted to switch between our (giphy-filled) slides and the Kahoot to ask them a few questions now and then about what we were talking about. When we actually had the lesson we decided to first just do all of the questions with Kahoot, talk a little about the answers and then dive deeper into them after the quiz. The kids really liked the quiz and already knew how it worked.\n\n*Tip:* make them understand that it is okay if they didn't get the answer. We also need to google most of what we do when we code.\n\n## Explain programming\nAs we only had 1,5 hours, we talked about a few basic things:\n\n* We dived into how a lot of things in our daily lives have a 'computer' inside of them. Washing machines, phones, laptops, tablets, consoles, even cars and satellites. And how cool it is that this means you can also program stuff for those devices.\n* We discussed how a computer knows what to do. For this we used the ['tell this person what to do'](#the-person-is-a-computer-exercise) exercise.\n* We explained how developers write computer programs, and that there are [different types of developers](#different-types-of-developers). We also talked about diversity in tech when it comes to people and their backgrounds, but also about the different types of developers.\n\n## The person is a computer exercise\nInspired by [@FloorDrees](https://twitter.com/FloorDrees) who did this exercise during a [RailsGirls](http://www.railsgirls.com) event. We let the kids steer me into writing a word on a whiteboard. The kids were pretty good at understanding that they had to be pretty specific in telling me what to do. 'Step forward', 'put your right hand forward' 'clench your hand around the object that is now referred to as a marker' etc. Some were even quick enough to understand that I had to remove the cap before writing.\n\n## Different types of developers\nThis is where our deep dive of their hobbies and interaction with the internet came in handy. We got to show them that there are different types of developers.\n* Some like to write software that helps get a rocket from the earth to mars.\n* Some want to make apps for phones and tablets, like TikTok, WhatsApp and SnapChat.\n* Some want to build websites, like the website of their favourite hiphop artists or YouTube.\n* Some want to make games, like Minecraft and Fortnite.\n\n\n## We let them 'hack' a website\nAfter the quiz and our explaining of what you can do with programming. We let them do a short 'hacking' exercise. On their laptops they got to go to their favourite website. Which, for most was YouTube or a popular news website as that is where we showed an example. Then by using `inspect` in the browser, we let them change the text of a video title or news article. This mostly resulted in videos of famous soccer players having titles with the kids names in them. They got to take screenshots which they got to share with their families later.\n\n## Wrapping it up\nFor the last few minutes one of us sat in front of the class to change colours and fonts on websites. After this we talked about how their changes will be lost once they refresh the page. And that it is a good thing that not anyone can just change news titles because then people could change other peoples work, or change the news however they would want. I think we were both very impressed on how aware the kids were of the danger of spreading lies and 'fake news'.\n\nThe kids also got to ask us a few more questions about what it is like to be a developer and how you can become one. Before we knew it, the lesson was over and the kids continued with their normal school day.\n\nWe had a huge amount of fun, but were exhausted 😂🥳. It was an amazing experience and if you ever get asked to do something similar, I would really consider going for it. It was very rewarding and simply loads of fun. Have you ever done something similar?

Check [the official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for information about the event and how to participate._\n\n## **1. 📚 Read the FAQ**\nTo understand how you can participate. Definitely read up on the  [official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for information about the event and participation. They also have a great FAQ with tips and tricks that might help you out getting started in October.\n\n## **2. 💪 Suppress that imposter syndrome**\nContributing to projects you are not familiar with can be quite daunting. But: Hacktoberfest is a stage for anyone that wants to try out contributing to open source. Your contribution doesn't have to be perfect and it doesn't have to be big.\n\nThis month is all about getting to know the open source community and becoming familiar with the process. Any valuable contribution counts. Improving documentation, picking up big or small issues, fixing bugs or adding new features are all an option. Even if you feel like you might not be able to do it, you are probably more than able. Still feeling insecure? Then maybe...\n\n## **3. 🍕 Get a group of enthusiasts together**\nWhy start join the event alone if you can get together for fun code evenings with friends or colleagues?\n\nCheck if people around you might be interested to participate in the event and organise evenings or weekends where you chill out together and try your best at working on some PR's. It helps keep you motivated and provides a great excuse for pizza's and drinks!\n\n## **4. 🔍 Find projects you like**\nFinding issues to work on can be tough during Hacktoberfest because loads of people jump on the chance to pick up an issue. That is why I recommend planning ahead a little bit. Maybe there is a project you use regularly in your daily job that you think could use some help? Documentation that can be improved for readability or a bug that needs fixing. Maybe you know someone who has a small open source project that they want more contributors for.\n\nAsk around with friends and check if there is anything that makes you motivated. Write down a list for yourself so you know where to start looking once the event starts.\n\nThere is even [a special Hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=label%3Ahacktoberfest\u0026type=Issues\u0026ref=advsearch\u0026l=\u0026l=) people can add to their project's issues to let others know they are open to new contributors. This can help you find something to work on.\n\n## **5. 📅 Block time in your calendar**\nIf you really want to contribute something valuable or fun, create time in your busy schedule to start coding. This will make it easier to find the time to work on something fun.\n\n_These are my tips to get ready for Hacktoberfest! Got tips or tricks? Share them in the comments!_\n\n**🍴 Extra beginner tip: learn how to fork a project**\nHacktoberfest is an awesome event for any beginner to start looking into open source contribution. Something I really needed to look into myself when I first started out is forking a project, and seeing how to keep your fork updated with the original one. So if you have no experience with that yet, maybe read [this awesome guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).\n","slug":"how-to-get-ready-for-hacktoberfest"}],"currentCategory":"beginner"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/category/[categoryname]","query":{"categoryname":"beginner"},"buildId":"YmhT5r3JO1OGFqrTvHtzw","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
