    I am a Front-End Developer from The Netherlands with a background in
    communication, photography and design. I spend my workdays happily coding at
    <a href="http://www.youngcapital.nl">YoungCapital</a>. During my free time I
    like to learn more, tinker on projects and enjoy myself with friends, games
    and plants.
