One of the things I really had to learn is that the basics are always the right priority to dive into. It does not matter what career goal you have, be it frontend, backend or anything in between or beyond. Understanding HTML, CSS and one of the many amazing programming language out there will be a good start to your career.\n\n## Which language to choose?\n\nThat depends on your own personal context. If you already landed a job and are expected to learn a specific language for it: choose that one. If you feel excited for another: go for the other one. When self-learning the key thing is motivation. Work with what makes you excited. Once you learn one language, the others can easily follow. Don’t feel rushed or pressured into something that does not ‘spark joy’.\n\nI started my journey through the RailsGirls community. So it felt right for me to follow some Ruby courses because I already knew people who could help me a little and it was the only language I had already seen. When I got hired as a frontend developer I picked up learning JavaScript. It was fun to see how some stuff was the same, and where the two languages differed. Again: once you know one language, others can easily follow.\n\n## You don’t know what you do not know\n\nOne of the reasons it is so hard when you are a beginner in tech is because you probably don’t know the gaps in your knowledge. Having a mentor, or knowing people who have more experience to help point into the right direction can be of huge help here. Luckily I was surrounded by an amazing group of people to point me into the right direction. Still, I was craving some more structure to help me set priorities when it came to learning the essentials.\n\n## Roadmap.sh\nThrough some luck I found [Kamran Ahmed’s](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) roadmap.sh. I checked out the frontend roadmap and was amazed at the way it helped me gain insight into things I did not know I could dive into. This is how I implemented it into my own learning:\n\n1. I created a markdown file and wrote down the list of things I wanted to learn using the roadmap.\n2. I went through the list and marked the ones that motivated me to learn, and the ones I knew could help me build the projects I was working on. I gave those extra priority.\n3. I went through the list again and for each topic I started searching the web for good resources that I could study to learn that subject matter. I did not study them immediately. I was just collecting and linking to those resources in the file. (Note: nowadays roadmap.sh has [some nice resources](https://roadmap.sh/guides) themselves for some subjects, make sure to check them out!).\n4. Every quarter I chose some subjects and studied the resources.\n5. When a subject was done, I had the satisfaction of checking the checkbox in front of it ✨\n\n## Projects will kickstart your career\nLast but not least: I noticed that through work and building personal projects, I was already able to check off some of the boxes on my list. Working on actual projects actually helps you learn so much quicker than doing courses, reading articles, books or watching videos. If you haven’t tried building something yourself yet: go for it! Find something that you think would be fun to build. Maybe try using a fun API that is available on the web. Like [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/), [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) or the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). It might feel daunting to start, but if you split up the project in small tasks it will become much easier.\n\n\nGood luck for all of you out there starting on your journeys. Don’t forget that the only person you should compare yourself with, is yourself. And every new thing you learn is one more thing you did not know before. Be nice to yourself and others, and build fun stuff.\n","slug":"2021-07-15-using-roadmapsh-for-structured-self-learning","date":["2021-07-15"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Finding meaning: landmarks explained","published":true,"description":"Learning more about HTML5 elements and their landmarks","intro":"Have you ever done a semantic html course? Or read about it? If you have, you might remember elements like \u003cmain\u003e, \u003csection\u003e or maybe \u003caside\u003e. But did you know that using these elements does not automatically provide the proper semantic meaning? Let's go on a journey of creating meaningful landmarks.","tags":"accessibility, html, a11y","cover_image":"you-are-here.jpg","cover_image_alt":"Two feet in the middle of a circle on the street that says you are here."},"markdownBody":"Cover image by [Fallon Michael](https://unsplash.com/@fallonmichaeltx?utm_source=unsplash\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/you-are-here?utm_source=unsplash\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_content=creditCopyText)\n\n## What is a landmark?\n\nLandmarks help identify the way a web page is organised and structured. A page with well-placed landmarks can help assistive technology make sense of the structure of the page. It can also help building 'skip-links' for quick and efficient navigation through the page while maintaining  context for the person browsing the page.\n\nTraditionally, it was possible to **explicitly** add landmark roles to HTML elements by using the `role` attribute:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv role=\"main\"\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eAn old school title\u003ch1\u003e\n  .... some amazing old school content ....\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nThankfully, with HTML5, we get HTML5 elements that can have an **implicit** landmark role.\n\n```html\n\u003cmain\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eSparkly new title\u003ch1\u003e\n  .... some amazing new content ....\n\u003c/main\u003e\n```\n\nThese **implicit** landmark roles have rules though. Not every one of these HTML5 elements automatically gets the correct landmark role. It all depends on wether or not the element is implemented properly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `\u003caside\u003e` - has a `complementary` landmark role. It is meant to add supporting content to the main content.\n- `\u003cform\u003e` - can have a `form` landmark role, but only when it is identifiable with an accessible name. It can also have a `search` landmark role if explicitly given `\u003cform role='search'\u003e`.\n- `\u003cheader\u003e` - can have a `banner` landmark role when used in the right context. This type of landmark role contains site-specific content or information.\n- `\u003cfooter\u003e` - can have a `contentinfo` landmark role, but only when used in a very specific way. Contentinfo is specifically the information usually found in footers like a privacy statement.\n- `\u003cmain\u003e` - has a `main` landmark role. It identifies the main content of the page, and each page should only have one.\n- `\u003cnav\u003e` - has a `navigation` landmark role. It identifies a group of links to navigate with.\n- `\u003csection\u003e` - can have a `region` landmark role, but only when it has an accessible name.\n\nAs you can see above, everything has a specific use and proper implementation. For example, if you are using the `\u003csection\u003e` element, it does not automatically add context to the page through an implicit landmark. You might have a nice structure like this:\n\n```html\n\u003cmain\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eA wonderful title\u003ch1\u003e\n  \u003csection\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eA cute little header in this section\u003c/h2\u003e\n    ... awesome content ...\n  \u003c/section\u003e\n  \u003csection\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eA nice header in the second section\u003c/h2\u003e\n    ... more awesome content ...\n  \u003c/section\u003e\n\u003c/main\u003e\n```\n\nThis is great! But the only thing it says about the page is that there are two sections. It does not tell the visitor anything about the specific purpose of that section. Because of this, the section will not be seen as having a `region` landmark role. It's just a container surrounding some elements.\n\n\u003e What is a region?\n\n\u003e A region landmark is a perceivable section containing content that is relevant to a specific, author-specified purpose and sufficiently important that users will likely want to be able to navigate to the section easily and to have it listed in a summary of the page.\n\n\u003e [W3C on region landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/region.html)\n\nIn this case, adding a unique label to each of these sections can help them become actual `regions`. For example by using `section[aria-labelledby]`, `section[aria-label]` or `section[title]`.\n\n## Tell me more!\n\nIf you want to know more about the specifics of landmarks, one resource that I really love is [ARIA landmarks example](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html). It has great quick and easy examples on how the different elements and landmark roles can, and should be used.\n","slug":"2021-02-23-finding-meaning-landmarks-explained","date":["2021-02-23"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"How to stay connected to your co-workers","published":true,"description":"Staying connected in a work-from-home world","intro":"Let’s be honest, every post nowadays starts with how weird 2020 has been.

People joined in a morning hangout to chat a bit and discuss what was happening in the world. I texted my friends: ‘*This is so much fun! I got to see a bunch of colleagues and their kids and pets in one screen!*’. I thought it was pretty cute to see the mayhem of cats trodding on keyboards and kids trying to get attention.\n\nOf course, trying to manage both work and kids at the same time soon became less cute and more work for most parents. For everyone reading this who dealt with that: you did a hell of a job. I look in awe at how you managed. Please try to be proud of yourself for going through this 👍.\n\n## Social initiatives\n\nHowever, not everyone was surrounded by family or roommates. Some of us said goodbye to social moments that normally power us through the day. Thankfully it was amazing to see the initiatives people came up with. Every morning we had a 'kitchen hangout' just to pop in and chat with co-workers. But especially in those first few weeks the 'library hangout' provided some support to those who worked alone from home and felt additional stress from what was happening in the world.\n\nYou’d open up the library hangout, turn off your mic and just work on stuff. No talking, just companionship. It was pretty cool. Thursday evenings became game night, and Fridays were set to have a remote afternoon of drinks and chill out.\n\nAll of this has subsided somewhat now. We are all a bit more used to this way of working, and we have been able to get a bit more socialising in during our free time. Still, how can we make sure we stay connected to our coworkers while working from home?\n\n## The 'why'\n\nNow, of course social interactions can also be energy draining for people. I am very much against pushing people into interactions that they do not feel comfortable with. Still, there is more to connecting with co-workers than the social aspect:\n\n- You get to find out what other people and teams are working on and learning from.\n- It is cool to find common ground and interests\n- You build a stronger foundation for working together on projects\n- It helps you find opportunities for your personal growth and the growth of others\n- The next time you are stuck on something, and you might need help that your teammates can not provide, you know who to turn to.\n\n## The 'how'\n\nDefault social places that we have for those who need an extra social kick:\n\n- **The Kitchen hangout** - there is still a kitchen hangout every day! And people still go there to chat a bit.\n- **Game night** - the game night stayed with us!\n- **Borrel** - there is a borrel every Friday, sometimes musical colleagues share some tunes.\n- **Donut** We've been really enjoying [Donut](https://www.donut.com/). In our case, donut will match you up with one or more people for a small chat once a week whenever you feel like it. It is still opt-in when the match is made.\n\nMore work related:\n\n- **Guilds** the benefits stated above are available for us in our frontend and backend guilds. It can be super nice to visit guilds because it keeps you up-to-date on what other people are working on, and allows for more in-depth discussions and idea sharing. We provide different types of meetings, from technical discussions to show-and-tells. We also mix the frontend and backend guild every once in a while.\n- **Standups** - start your standup 5 minutes earlier to chat a bit more with your colleagues about something else but work.\n- **Project check-ins** - working on a cross-team project? How about saying no to slack every now and then and just doing a short hangout to sync up?\n- **Team retro’s** - just in case you’re not doing them yet. It can be super nice to help people express how they feel about the way things are going and improve on team work. We have been using [Parabol](https://www.parabol.co/) to help manage the retro's.\n- **Just message a random colleague outside your team** - A fun challenge to message a random colleague and ask what they have been working on.\n\nThat's my input! Nothing new probably. But I am curious how you stay connected and how this has all been for you?\n","slug":"2020-12-14-how-to-stay-connected-to-your-co-workers","date":["2020-12-14"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Test global npm packages in a quick and easy way","published":true,"description":"A quick guide on testing out local global npm packages line using npm or yarn.","intro":"You might already be used to creating symlinks between projects locally using yarn or npm. But what if you are  working on a cli package that you want the user to use globally? You also want to be able to test your package locally to make sure everything is working as it should. But how do you do this? Here’s an easy guide on achieving a link to a local project to test out globally in your command line using either yarn or npm.","tags":"beginner, javascript, npm, yarn","cover_image":"2020-06-16-cover_image.png","cover_image_alt":"illustration of chains"},"markdownBody":"\n## How do you link projects?\n\nLet’s say you are working on a React app and you have another project, like a component library, that you are also working on at the same time. You want to make changes in your component library and test them out in your React app without first having to deploy the entire package right? Let’s talk about how you can actually do this. Please don’t forget: the React app and component library are examples. You can do this with any project.\n\n### 1. Making your package available\n\nFirst we need to make the package (in our example a component library) available in your local system by going into its folder using your terminal and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link\n\n# npm\nnpm link\n```\n\n\n**What does this do?**\n\nThis command creates a symlink to our package in a specific location. You can see them in the location by going to the location:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\ncd ~/.config/yarn/link\n\n# npm\n# first figure out where your npm packages are saved by running\n\nnpm config ls -l\n\n# find the ‘prefix’ key\n# you can find where your packages are saved in\n\ncd {prefix}/lib/node_modules\n```\n\nThen run `ls` to see a list of all the packages that are installed.\n\n\n\u003e **You keep talking about symlinks. What are those?**\n\u003e A symlink (or ‘symbolic link’) is a file that has a reference to another file. You can also explain it as being a file that points to another file, or you can see it as a ‘shortcut’ on your computer.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhen you create a symlink you are telling your computer to create a link to file A. This link is saved in file B. When we want to use file B, we are essentially using file A.\n\n### 2. Linking to your package\n\nWe now go to the project where you want to use the package (in our example the React app). In here we run\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nyarn link “catpaws”\n\n# npm\nnpm link \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nnpm link “catpaws”\n```\n\nAwesome.\n\nYour project now has its package linked locally so you can test everything out. Are you done testing? Then make sure to unlink the package in your project folder by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink \u003cpackage name\u003e\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink \u003cpackage name\u003e\n```\n\nAnd remove the package from the symlinks list by going to the folder of your package and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink\n```\n\n\n## How to link to your package globally?\n\nSo it’s all great to know how to create local links between projects, but how about when you don’t have a project, but your computer that needs to globally link to your local package? Well, it’s actually a bit different, but still super easy. First, let’s check which packages you already have installed globally by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn global list\n\n# yarn\nnpm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true\n```\n\nYou should get a nice overview of stuff that is already installed.\n\n### 1. Link to your package.\n\n**yarn**\nIn your terminal, run `yarn global add /full/path/to/package`.\nIf we now run `yarn global list` again, we should see the name of our package in the list.\n\nIf you want to remove it you simply run `yarn global remove “package name”`.\n\nNow there is a tricky part here. Yarn does not fully seem to support globally linking to local packages yet so the way we do this is actually a bit hacky. You see, yarn does not automatically update the package you have added, so for each change you want to test, you have to add it again...\n\nIt's easier with npm:\n\n**npm**\nWith npm it it the same as before, but we just go to the folder of our package and run `npm link`.\n\nIf you now run `npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true` you’ll see that your package is in the list.\n\nYou remove it from the list by going into the package folder and running `npm unlink`.\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing either yarn or npm, once you know how, it can be easy to create symlinks to test any package between projects, or in global mode. Right now, npm seems to have the easiest workflow.\n\nI got stuck the first time I had to develop something that I wanted to test globally and it took me some time to figure out how to make this work. I hope this helps others who might encounter the same problem. If you have any other way to do this please share them in the comments so we can all learn from it 👍.\n","slug":"2020-06-16-Test-global-npm-packages-in-a-quick-and-easy-way","date":["2020-06-16"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"The basics of a function, illustrated! ✨","published":true,"description":"Learn about JavaScript functions with a simple metaphor.","intro":"One thing that can be difficult to understand when you just start out learning how to program is what a function is and how it works.

Inside this building, we set everything in place so the factory can receive whatever raw materials it needs and return whatever product we want as output.\n\nLet’s say we want to build a factory that takes any number and adds two.

It then returns the output which is the combination of `num + 2`.\n\n\u003e### About `num`\n\u003e`num` is just a representation, or container, for what we get as input. We can even rename it into whatever we want. If we were making a factory that added two apples to a number of bananas, we could rename `num` to `bananas`. The input would be a number of bananas, the output would be a number of bananas plus two apples.\n\nDo you see that we also gave the factory a name? `plusTwo`. This makes it a bit easier for when we want to refer to the factory. This way we can tell our workers: ‘I want you to use the factory `plusTwo` to process a specific number and add 2’.\n\nOur factory is ready to be used now. To use it we need to provide a number as input. Let’s say we want to give it a `3` as input. We can’t see what is happening inside the factory but we can see what is returned from the factory: it’s a 5 (3 + 2 = 5):\n\n![The outside of a factory that takes in 3 and returns 5](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o65pxtvzpgwjbkccobaa.png)\n\n## Let’s get coding\n\nFunctions essentially work the same way. Instead of building an imaginary factory, let’s actually start creating a function in JavaScript.\n\nWe first set up the function, these are like the walls of the factory. For convenience, we will also give the function a name, just like we did with the factory. We’ll call it `plusTwo`.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo( ) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe are then going to define what we are expecting the program to get as input. We call these `arguments` or `parameters`. In this case, we are expecting to get one number. And because it can be any type of number, we’re going to give it a more generic name like `num`. We will define this argument within the two parentheses `()`. Look at it as the door that allows our input arguments to enter the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe’ll now finish the function by saying exactly what it needs to do and return. It needs to return the sum of `num` and 2. This will become the output of the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n    return num + 2;\n}\n\n```\n\nNow the function is ready to be used. It knows what it is going to get as input, and what it needs to return as output. The part where we use the word `return` is actually really important. This tells the function to `return` our output.\n\nOtherwise, it is kind of like closing the output door to our factory: the produced results cannot leave the factory:\n\n![The factory output door is closed and none of the product can get out](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/b77bysgp94758d7vx8ul.png)\n\n\u003e### Again, what is `num`?\n\u003eWe can rename `num` into whatever we like. It is just a name that we make up to define whatever enters our function. For example, the following two functions would have the exact same result:\n\n```js\nfunction plusTwo(x) {\n    return x + 2;\n}\n\nfunction plusTwoApples(numberOfApples) {\n    return numberOfApples + 2;\n}\n```\n\n\u003e`x` and `numberOfApples` are simply names we give whatever arguments we are going to get. While we could use `x` as a name for our arguments, it does not tell us a lot about what we are getting. This is why we try to give it a more descriptive name.\n\nFrom now on, if you want to code along, you can actually [open developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on this page and first type the function that we made just now, press return on your keyboard, and follow along for the next part.\n\n## Start using the function\n\nWe can now actually start using the function. Remember that we gave both the factory and the function a name? Just like with the factory, we can now tell our workers (in this case, our program) to use the function `plusTwo` to process a number and add 2’.\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(3) // returns 5\n\n```\n\nWe pass the number 3 into the doors that are our parentheses. In the function, this means that `num` now is a representation of 3. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 3.\n\nIf we pass 5, it will return 7:\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(5) // returns 7\n\n```\n\nAgain, in our function `num` now is a representation of 5. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 5.\n\nAnd that’s it! There is a lot more to learn about functions, but these are the basics that should help you get on your way! I hope it helps anyone learning this for the first time to understand the concepts a bit more.\n\n\n\n","slug":"2020-05-21-The-basics-of-a-function-illustrated","date":["2020-05-21"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Redirection and pipeline magic","published":true,"description":"For when you don't feel like diving deep into bash but do want to know what redirection is when you see it.","intro":"Enough developers out there deliver great day-to-day work without having to touch bash whatsoever. Yet, every now and then we all encounter a piece of bash script, be it from a colleague or copied from a Stack Overflow post. Yeah, the script works, but do we understand what is happening? I wanted to know myself so I started small. Let's dive into redirection.","tags":null,"cover_image":"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sp68ef6310avveg2dxjp.png","cover_image_alt":"illustration of lines and arrows going in different directions"},"markdownBody":"\n## Redirection\n\nA program that runs in the command line always has three important ways to connect with it; the input, output, and possible error output of the program. We call these types of connections data- or file streams.\n\nExamples:\n\n- The _input_ of a program can be a keyboard or the output of another command, file, or program.\n- Examples of the _output_ or _error output_ could be another file or the terminal.\n\nThese three file streams have specific names and even values. These values are called 'file descriptors'. File descriptors are nothing more than numbers that are given to specific files. These three, have the numbers 0 to 2:\n\n| Name            | Symbolic name | File descriptor | Sign | Default  |\n| --------------- | ------------- | :-------------: | :--: | -------- |\n| Standard input  | stdin         |        0        |  \u003c   | Keyboard |\n| Standard output | stdout        |        1        |  \u003e   | Terminal |\n| Standard error  | stderr        |        2        |  2\u003e  | Terminal |\n\nWe can change the sources of these streams. This is what we call redirection.\n\n_Example_\n\nLet's say we have a list of animals in a file called `animals.txt`.\n\n```text\npuppy\nkangaroo\nkitten\nsnake\nwombat\ntiger\nbird\n```\n\nWhat if we want to sort this list and save the outcome to a new file?\n\n```\n$ sort \u003c animals.txt \u003e sortedAnimals.txt\n```\n\nWe call the `sort` command and give it `animals.txt` as input by using the `\u003c` symbol. Then we set the `sortedAnimals.txt` file as the output by using the `\u003e` symbol.\n\nWhen we open the `sortedAnimals.txt` file we will find:\n\n```text\nbird\nkangaroo\nkitten\npuppy\nsnake\ntiger\nwombat\n```\n\nNow, what if we wanted to sort a file that does not exist? For example:\n\n```shell\n$ sort \u003c ghostFile.txt \u003e sortedGhostFile.txt\n-bash: ghostFile.txt: No such file or directory\n```\n\nWe get an error thrown into the terminal. Of course, this is good because we want to get feedback on why something is not working. But what if we didn’t want the error to be thrown into the terminal, but written to a file? We could redirect the standard error (`stderr`) to a file as well:\n\n```shell\n$ sort 2\u003e sortedGhostFileError.txt \u003c ghostFile.txt\n```\n\nWe first say where the `stderr` of `sort` needs to direct to with the 2\u003e sign. Then we say that `ghostFile.txt` needs to be input for the sort command by using the `\u003c` sign. If you were to check, you would see that the file `sortedGhostFileError.txt` has been created and it contains the same error we saw printed into the terminal before.\n\nYou can also write the standard output and standard error to the same file. There are two ways to do this.\n\n```shell\n$ sort \u003e ghostFileOutput.txt 2\u003e\u00261 \u003c ghostFile.txt\n```\n\nWe first define that `ghostFileOutput.txt` is the output, and then use the `2\u003e\u00261` sign to redirect the standard error (2) to standard output (1).\n\nYou can also use the shorthand:\n\n```shell\n$ sort \u0026\u003e ghostFileOutput.txt \u003c ghostFile.txt\n```\n\n## Pipelines\n\nOur next step in understanding redirection is by understanding ‘Pipelines’. The pipe operator `|` lets us chain different commands together. This can be very useful. It lets us write small programs or commands, and chain them to let them perform more complex tasks. With the pipe symbol, you can use the output of one command as the input of the next.\n\nLet's say that we want to use the same `list.txt` we had before. We want to sort the list and grab the animal that is first in the list after sorting. We could do:\n\n```shell\n$ sort animals.txt | head -1\n```\n\nThis will first sort the `list.txt` file, use the outcome of that as the input of the `head -1` command, which will grab only the first line of the input it gets. As we have not specified what output the last command should have, it just prints `bird` to the terminal. As it is the first animal in the sorted list.\n\nWe could also save that animal as a separate file by combining our pipe symbol with one of the redirection symbols:\n\n```shell\n$ sort animals.txt | head -1 \u003e first-animal.txt\n```\n\nThis will save the outcome to a file called `first-animal.txt`.\n\n## Redirection summary\n\nSo, a file can have input, output, and error output. We can explicitly say where these three need to point at. This is possible by using different signs or operators. Including `\u003c`, `\u003e`, `2\u003e`, and the pipe operator `|`. If you want to read more about this try typing `man bash` in your terminal and search for `/REDIRECTION`. Other than that, try it out yourself by fiddling around in your terminal.

No worries, there is hope!"},"markdownBody":"\nIn this blog, I'll explain how you can change the terminal's prompt to look just the way you want to.\n\n## What is the PS1 variable?\n\nWhen looking at our terminal we can see the command prompt. Depending on your system it will have some information in there. In the case of a standard Raspberry Pi it might look something like this:\n\n```bash\npi@raspberrypi:~ $\n```\n\nThe part `pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ` is actually a shell variable called `PS1`. There are actually five of these variables. `PS0`, `PS1`, `PS2`, `PS3`, `PS4`. Each of them is set up in a different way. To find out more about these variables you can look it up in _the manual_ 📖 (`$ man bash`) underneath `Shell Variables`.\n\n## How is PS1 set up?\n\nWe can see how the variable is set up by typing\n\n```bash\n$ echo $PS1\n```\nThis will return `\\\\u@\\\\h:\\\\W\\\\a\\\\] $` in our example. The characters here actually represent a few things.\n\nThe `PS1` variable in our example consists of:\n\n* **\\\\u = pi** - the username\n* **@** - the character `@`\n* **\\\\h = raspberrypi** - the hostname\n* **:** - the character `:`\n* **\\\\W = ~~** - the current working directory\n* **\\\\a]** - an ASCII bell character\n* ** $** - a space and the `$` character\n\nThere are many of these characters that you can use. It's easy to find them by opening the bash manual (`man bash`) and searching for `PROMPTING`. It will give you a list of available backslash-escaped special characters.\n\nWe can change this variable very easily. Let's set it up to only show the username and current working directory:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\u [\\\\w]: \\\"\n```\n\n## Using colors\n\nWe can also use different colors in our Prompt. To check out what options we have, we can find them using `man terminal colors`. You'll find a list of available colors there:\n\n```\n0 to restore default color\n\n1 for brighter colors\n4 for underlined text\n5 for flashing text\n30 for black foreground\n31 for red foreground\n32 for green foreground\n33 for yellow (or brown) foreground\n34 for blue foreground\n35 for purple foreground\n36 for cyan foreground\n37 for white (or gray) foreground\n40 for black background\n41 for red background\n42 for green background\n43 for yellow (or brown) background\n44 for blue background\n45 for purple background\n46 for cyan background\n47 for white (or gray) background\n```\n\nWe can set a foreground and background color for our prompt. For example, let's turn the background purple and the foreground a white color.\n\nInside your terminal type:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\e[45;37m\\\\ \\\\u [\\\\w]:\\\\e[0m \\\"\n```\n\nLet's look at the first part `\\\\e[45;37m`.\n* `\\\\e[` tells bash that we are giving new color information\n* `45` the background color purple\n* `;` just a separation between the colors\n* `37` the foreground color white\n* `m` indicates the end of the color definitions\n\nKnowing this, we can also see that the end part `\\\\e[0m ` resets everything back to default. To see what happens if we keep this out, try setting it without the end part.\n\nNow for the last personalization...\n\n## Using special characters\n\nLet's spice it up a bit more by adding a few more bits and bobs. (Get it? bits? No? Alrighty...).\n\nI want to use a few special characters to give a fading look, `▓`, `▒` and `░`. In order to include these in the `PS1` variable, we're going to need their octal numbers. I used [Graphemica.com](http://graphemica.com/unicode/characters) to find the octal numbers.\n\n* ▓ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223`\n* ▒ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222`\n* ░ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221`\n\nWhen we want to put them together we just chain the numbers: `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221`. We also want to set the right colors. So we'll turn the foreground color purple and the background color back to default by adding `\\\\e[0;35m`. We add this right after the working directory character as such:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\e[45;37m \\\\u [\\\\w]\\\\e[0;35m\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221:\\\\e[0m \\\"\n```\nThis will set up us with something looking like this:\n\n![The end result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1ihzx5aquvinnreuo2xa.png)\n\nOf course, there are other creative things you can do and other characters you can use.\n\n## Setting it in your bash files\n\nNow that we have something fun set up, let's make sure it is permanent. You can do this by setting this variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\n\n```\nPS1=\"\\e[45;37m \\u [\\w]\\e[0;35m\\342\\226\\223\\342\\226\\222\\342\\226\\221:\\e[0m\"\n```\n\nAnd that's it! This way, your prompt will look this way, even if you restart your computer.\n\nI'm really curious about other awesome ways there are to personalize the terminal. And also to see what types of combinations people can come up with to personalize their prompt, so please share your creations!\n","slug":"2020-02-17-personalize-your-Linux-terminal-prompt","date":["2020-02-17"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Get a head start with your new app - CRA custom templates","published":true,"description":"Let's take a look at Create React App's custom templates","tags":null,"intro":"Create React App (CRA) already increases the speed of getting a new React app up and running. You run one script and it creates a functioning React app that you can start working on. With Custom Templates things have become even easier. In this post, we're going to discover what goes into creating a custom template."},"markdownBody":"\nCustom templates became available with `react-scripts@3.3.0`. They make it possible to predefine exactly what you want CRA's output to be. For example, maybe you want a few basic components ready, have some dependencies or scripts pre-installed in your `package.json` or add some config files for ESlint or Prettier.\n\n## CRA Templates dissected\n\nTemplates are nothing more than npm packages exporting specific configuration options for CRA + an example of what the generated app should look like.\n\nI'm going to dive a little deeper into [the example](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/) from CRA's documentation.\n\nWhen we look at the folder structure of a custom template, it looks something like this:\n\n```\nmy-cra-template\n├── README.md // the readme of the custom template package itself\n├── template.json // more on this file later\n├── package.json // the package.json for the custom template package itself\n└── template //more on this folder later\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── gitignore\n    └── public\n       └── index.html\n    └── src\n       └── index.js (or index.tsx)\n```\n\nThe `my-cra-template` folder contains a `README.md`, `template.json` and `package.json`. These all belong specifically to the CRA template package that you are trying to make. The `README.md` contains info about the package and the `package.json` has package info for npm. You can put whatever you want in your `package.json`, just make sure your package's name starts with `cra-template-...`.\n\n## What creates the template\nThe `template.json` file and the `template` folder are the pieces that actually tell CRA what to generate:\n\nThe `template.json` file is the place where we define the following:\n* **Dependencies** - the dependencies you want CRA to install in any new app.\n* **Scripts** - any scripts that you want CRA to put in the `package.json` file of any new app it creates with this template.\n\nFor now, it is not yet possible to add any `devDependencies` to the template. To make it easy for the user to add those, you can always specify them inside your package's readme so they can copy and paste it quickly.\n\nThe `template` folder essentially holds an example of how you want the generated app to look like. An easy way to create it is by creating a new app with CRA, modify it exactly the way you like. You could add some configuration files (like .eslintrc for example) or specify a folder structure with files. Then copy it into the `templates` and inside that folder:\n\n* turn `.gitignore` into `gitignore`\n* remove the `package.json` and lockfile\n* customize how you would like the generated app's `README.md` to look like.\n\nMake sure you at least have the minimum files inside your `templates` folder that the [CRA documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/) specifies.\n\nLike mentioned above; CRA has two default templates that you can look into to understand how it works:\n\n* [cra-template-typescript](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template-typescript)\n* [cra-template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template)\n\nAnd that's it!

In this post we're going to automatically run a script when we turn the Pi on and stop and clear the LEDs when we turn it off."},"markdownBody":"\n_You can actually use the techniques in this tutorial for any other script or board._\n\n## Start the script when the Pi turns on\n\nThere are many different ways to start running a script when the Pi is booting up. We are going to use `crontab`.\n\nWith `crontab` we can automate running a script at a certain moment. There are different options, such as running a script `yearly`, `daily` or on `reboot`. We will be using that last option 😉.\n\nMake sure to be logged into your Pi and in the terminal run:\n\n```bash\n$ crontab -e\n```\n\nThis will open `crontab` in your editor. At the bottom of the file add:\n\n```bash\n@reboot python /home/pi/Pimoroni/blue_purple.py \u0026\n```\n\nWe use `@reboot` to tell the `crontab` that we want to run the script whenever the device reboots. `python` is used to run the Python script and `\u0026` makes the script run as a background script so you can use your terminal while the script is running. Make sure to add the absolute path to the script you want to run when starting up.\n\nSave and close the file, that's it for the first part. You can now restart your Pi with `sudo reboot` and it should automatically start running your script in the background once it starts up again.\n\n### How to kill your background process\n\nIf for any reason you want to stop the script, all you have to do is find its Process Identifier (PID) by running `ps aux | grep python` and finding the script in the list of processes. The output would look something like this:\n\n```bash\npi         394 35.3  1.7  32420 16352 ?        S    12:09  34:34 python /home/pi/Pimoroni/blue_purple.py\npi         771  0.0  0.0   7348   492 pts/0    S+   13:46   0:00 grep --color=auto python\n\n```\n\nThe PID is the number right next to the `pi`. In the example, it is `394` Once you have the PID run `kill 349` replacing `349` with the number of your PID.\n\n### Turning off the LEDs and clearing them\n\nLet's run a little test. Try shutting down your Pi while the LEDs are running. We can do that by typing:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo shutdown now\n```\n\nThe Pi will shut itself down and the background script will also stop running. But you might notice that the LEDs did not clear. The Blinkt library has a function for clearing the LEDs when the script stops: `blinkt.set_clear_on_exit()`. But that only works when the script is explicitly stopped by us. On shutdown, this will have no effect. And as the Blinkt pixels seem to have memory, they will not clear unless we tell them to, or turn off the power.\n\nSo, let's fix this.\n\nInside our Python script we are going to add a new library called `signal` underneath our other libraries:\n\n```py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport blinkt\nimport time\nimport numpy\nimport signal # new one!\n\n```\n\nThis will import the `signal` library. This library listens for signals from the system and makes it possible to run a function when we receive a specific signal.\n\nWhen our Pi shuts down, it will send a signal called `SIGTERM`. This signal is sent whenever the system is doing a soft shutdown.\n\nIf our script receives this signal, we want to clear the LEDs and exit from the Python script. So in our Python file, add:\n\n```py\ndef clear_leds(signum, frame):\n        blinkt.clear()\n        blinkt.show()\n        exit(0)\n\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, clear_leds)\n```\n\nThe `clear_led` function has two arguments it automatically receives from the `signal.signal()` function. We don't really need to use that so we just keep them there. The `blinkt.clear()` clears the LEDs and the `blinkt.show()` sets the new changes to the Blinkt so they can be seen. We then exit the Python script with `exit(0)`.\n\nBy writing `signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, clear_leds)` the script will listen for the `SIGTERM` signal. Once it receives it, it will run the `clear_leds` function.\n\nAnd that's it! Reboot your system and once your LEDs are running again, try shutting the Pi off by using `sudo shutdown now`. After a second or so the LEDs should clear.\n\nI had to find different sources to create this flow, so hopefully, this helps out anyone who wants to set it up the same way.

The rounded corners of the Blinkt should align with the Pi's rounded corner.\n\nMake sure you are logged into your Pi and in the terminal run\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://get.pimoroni.com/blinkt | bash\n```\n\nThis will install the software you'll need to run the Blinkt. We're using the [documentation](http://docs.pimoroni.com/blinkt/) to learn how to set up a linear blue/purple pattern.\n\nCreate and open a new Python file in your terminal. In my case I created one in the Pimoroni folder:\n\n```bash\n$ nano Pimoroni/blue_purple.py\n```\n\nI did this using the `nano` editor. You can also create a file another way and open it in your preferred editor.\n\n## Import dependencies\n\nFirst, we need to import the libraries we need. At the top of the file we import `blinkt` to control the LEDs, `time` to create time-outs and `numpy` to create a range of decimals later on.\n\n```py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport blinkt\nimport time\nimport numpy\n\n```\n\n## Variables\n\nCreate a list of colors in RGB format. With this, I mean that we create a list of lists. Each small list contains a number for r, g, and b.\n\nThen we use `numpy` to create a range of floats between `0` and `0.5`. The range is made with steps of `0.03`. This range will help us gradually light up each pixel.\n\n```py\nCOLOR_LIST = [[0, 127, 255], [0, 0, 255], [127, 0, 255], [255, 0, 255], [255, 0, 127]]\nBRIGHTNESS_RANGE = numpy.arange(0, 0.5, 0.03)\n```\n\nAdd the following script to ensure that if the script stops, the LEDs clear.\n\n```py\nblinkt.set_clear_on_exit()\n```\n\n## Setting the pixels\n\nWe will create a function that takes a pixel, the RGB colors and a range of values that represent the different brightnesses as arguments. It will loop over the list of values for brightness and for every brightness value it will set a pixel with the correct color.\n\n```py\ndef set_brightness(pixel, r, g, b, brightRange):\n    for brightness in brightRange:\n        blinkt.set_pixel(pixel, r, g, b, brightness)\n\tblinkt.show()\n        # we need to run show after setting the pixel\n        # otherwise we won't see anything change.\n\ttime.sleep(0.01)\n        # give it a little time to add a slight effect.\n```\n\n## While loop\n\nNow we're going to get to the actual loop that is going to make our Pimoroni Blinkt light up.\n\n\nWe are going to start a while loop and inside loop over every color array in `COLOR_LIST`.\n\nWhen we run the script inside the terminal and press `CTRL-C` it will throw a KeyboardInterrupt exception. Because we want to make sure we can stop our `While True` loop, we use `try` and listen for the exception to stop the loop.\n\nThe blinkt library has its own constant called `blinkt.NUM_PIXELS` that spits out the amount of pixels that are available on the device. For every pixel, we call the `set_brightness` function. We pass the pixel and RGB colors, together with the `BRIGHTNESS_RANGE`.\n\n\n```py\ntry:\n    while True:\n        for color in COLOR_LIST:\n            for pixel in range(blinkt.NUM_PIXELS):\n                set_brightness(pixel, color[0], color[1], color[2], BRIGHTNESS_RANGE)\n            for pixel in reversed(range(blinkt.NUM_PIXELS)):\n                set_brightness(pixel, color[0], color[1], color[2], reversed(BRIGHTNESS_RANGE))\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    pass\n```\n\nBecause we want the pixels to light up, and then gradually turn off again, we do a reversed for loop. See the difference between the two? We use `reversed(range(blinkt.NUM_PIXELS))` and we also send a reversed `BRIGHTNESS_RANGE`.\n\nThis is it for now! Try it out by saving the file and running it:\n\n```bash\n$ python blue_purple.py\n```\n\nTo stop the script, use `CTRL-C`.\n\nThis is only the first part. In [the next post](https://dev.to/khenhey/light-up-leds-when-you-start-your-raspberry-pi-and-clear-them-on-shutdown-542), we will set up our Raspberry Pi so it starts running this script as a background process on startup, and close it when we shut the Pi down.\n\n**Check the [finished script](https://github.com/khendrikse/blinkt-purple-blue/blob/master/blue_purple.py)**\n\n_Sources:_\n[Get started with Blinkt](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-blinkt)\n[Pimoroni Blinkt Documentation](http://docs.pimoroni.com/blinkt/#enable-disable-clear-on-exit)\n[KeyboardInterrupt](http://effbot.org/zone/stupid-exceptions-keyboardinterrupt.htm)\n","slug":"2020-01-26-beautify-your-raspberry-pi-with-the-pimoroni-blinkt","date":["2020-01-26"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Coding with a group of 11 year olds","published":true,"description":"Get them 'hacking' their favourite websites","tags":"beginner, teaching, tutorial, programming","intro":"Recently a we were asked if we could give a short lesson about coding to a group of 11 year olds in primary school. So my colleague and me started preparing a 1,5 hour workshop with the goal of showing the kids how much fun programming could be. This is the story of how it went.","cover_image":"https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lZlI5EjpMCaVdC/giphy.gif","cover_image_alt":"a cute moving image with a keyboard and cartoon cats going up and down"},"markdownBody":"\n## Get to know what they love\nOur goal was to stay as close to their own interests as possible. So with a little bit of research we discovered that these kids really loved to use mobile phones and consoles outside of school. Generally most of them knew and used apps like TikTok, SnapChat and WhatsApp, they regularly visited YouTube for watching videos and some of the kids played Minecraft or Fortnite at home.\n\n## Make it interactive\nTo keep them engaged we used [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). We wanted to switch between our (giphy-filled) slides and the Kahoot to ask them a few questions now and then about what we were talking about. When we actually had the lesson we decided to first just do all of the questions with Kahoot, talk a little about the answers and then dive deeper into them after the quiz. The kids really liked the quiz and already knew how it worked.\n\n*Tip:* make them understand that it is okay if they didn't get the answer. We also need to google most of what we do when we code.\n\n## Explain programming\nAs we only had 1,5 hours, we talked about a few basic things:\n\n* We dived into how a lot of things in our daily lives have a 'computer' inside of them. Washing machines, phones, laptops, tablets, consoles, even cars and satellites. And how cool it is that this means you can also program stuff for those devices.\n* We discussed how a computer knows what to do. For this we used the ['tell this person what to do'](#the-person-is-a-computer-exercise) exercise.\n* We explained how developers write computer programs, and that there are [different types of developers](#different-types-of-developers). We also talked about diversity in tech when it comes to people and their backgrounds, but also about the different types of developers.\n\n## The person is a computer exercise\nInspired by [@FloorDrees](https://twitter.com/FloorDrees) who did this exercise during a [RailsGirls](http://www.railsgirls.com) event. We let the kids steer me into writing a word on a whiteboard. The kids were pretty good at understanding that they had to be pretty specific in telling me what to do. 'Step forward', 'put your right hand forward' 'clench your hand around the object that is now referred to as a marker' etc. Some were even quick enough to understand that I had to remove the cap before writing.\n\n## Different types of developers\nThis is where our deep dive of their hobbies and interaction with the internet came in handy. We got to show them that there are different types of developers.\n* Some like to write software that helps get a rocket from the earth to mars.\n* Some want to make apps for phones and tablets, like TikTok, WhatsApp and SnapChat.\n* Some want to build websites, like the website of their favourite hiphop artists or YouTube.\n* Some want to make games, like Minecraft and Fortnite.\n\n\n## We let them 'hack' a website\nAfter the quiz and our explaining of what you can do with programming. We let them do a short 'hacking' exercise. On their laptops they got to go to their favourite website. Which, for most was YouTube or a popular news website as that is where we showed an example. Then by using `inspect` in the browser, we let them change the text of a video title or news article. This mostly resulted in videos of famous soccer players having titles with the kids names in them. They got to take screenshots which they got to share with their families later.\n\n## Wrapping it up\nFor the last few minutes one of us sat in front of the class to change colours and fonts on websites. After this we talked about how their changes will be lost once they refresh the page. And that it is a good thing that not anyone can just change news titles because then people could change other peoples work, or change the news however they would want. I think we were both very impressed on how aware the kids were of the danger of spreading lies and 'fake news'.\n\nThe kids also got to ask us a few more questions about what it is like to be a developer and how you can become one. Before we knew it, the lesson was over and the kids continued with their normal school day.\n\nWe had a huge amount of fun, but were exhausted 😂🥳. It was an amazing experience and if you ever get asked to do something similar, I would really consider going for it. It was very rewarding and simply loads of fun. Have you ever done something similar?

That means it's almost time for Hacktoberfest! Last year it was a great opportunity for me to get to know the open source community and to spend time coding something different for a change. As I enjoyed the event so much, I'd love to help others out getting a head start for this awesome month-long event!","tags":"beginner, hacktoberfest, open source","cover_image":"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jq4249imytytcvw3ewpg.png","cover_image_alt":"the hacktoberfest logo"},"markdownBody":"\n_No idea what Hacktoberfest is? Check [the official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for information about the event and how to participate._\n\n## **1. 📚 Read the FAQ**\nTo understand how you can participate. Definitely read up on the  [official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for information about the event and participation. They also have a great FAQ with tips and tricks that might help you out getting started in October.\n\n## **2. 💪 Suppress that imposter syndrome**\nContributing to projects you are not familiar with can be quite daunting. But: Hacktoberfest is a stage for anyone that wants to try out contributing to open source. Your contribution doesn't have to be perfect and it doesn't have to be big.\n\nThis month is all about getting to know the open source community and becoming familiar with the process. Any valuable contribution counts. Improving documentation, picking up big or small issues, fixing bugs or adding new features are all an option. Even if you feel like you might not be able to do it, you are probably more than able. Still feeling insecure? Then maybe...\n\n## **3. 🍕 Get a group of enthusiasts together**\nWhy start join the event alone if you can get together for fun code evenings with friends or colleagues?\n\nCheck if people around you might be interested to participate in the event and organise evenings or weekends where you chill out together and try your best at working on some PR's. It helps keep you motivated and provides a great excuse for pizza's and drinks!\n\n## **4. 🔍 Find projects you like**\nFinding issues to work on can be tough during Hacktoberfest because loads of people jump on the chance to pick up an issue. That is why I recommend planning ahead a little bit. Maybe there is a project you use regularly in your daily job that you think could use some help? Documentation that can be improved for readability or a bug that needs fixing. Maybe you know someone who has a small open source project that they want more contributors for.\n\nAsk around with friends and check if there is anything that makes you motivated. Write down a list for yourself so you know where to start looking once the event starts.\n\nThere is even [a special Hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=label%3Ahacktoberfest\u0026type=Issues\u0026ref=advsearch\u0026l=\u0026l=) people can add to their project's issues to let others know they are open to new contributors. This can help you find something to work on.\n\n## **5. 📅 Block time in your calendar**\nIf you really want to contribute something valuable or fun, create time in your busy schedule to start coding. This will make it easier to find the time to work on something fun.\n\n_These are my tips to get ready for Hacktoberfest! Got tips or tricks? Share them in the comments!_\n\n**🍴 Extra beginner tip: learn how to fork a project**\nHacktoberfest is an awesome event for any beginner to start looking into open source contribution. Something I really needed to look into myself when I first started out is forking a project, and seeing how to keep your fork updated with the original one. So if you have no experience with that yet, maybe read [this awesome guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).\n","slug":"2019-09-19-how-to-get-ready-for-hacktoberfest","date":["2019-09-19"]},{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Awesome soft, airy and fluffy VSC themes","published":true,"description":"These themes will lift you off for cozy coding.","tags":"theme, vsc, pastel, productivity,","intro":"When coding I sometimes feel the need to change the aesthetics of my workspace. Why? I don't know. Maybe because it gives me a fresh look at my code. Maybe because with the seasons changing, I feel the need to lighten or darken my workspace colours. Either way, for those searching for something airy and new. Here is a list of wonderful Visual Studio Code themes that have a cozy, soft or fluffy aesthetic."},"markdownBody":"\n## **1. [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)**\nNoctis is a collection of light \u0026 dark themes that have soft blends of colours with enough choice of different contrasts.\n\n![An image showing the Noctis Lilac theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q17vuc93wq2sdk64tal0.png)\n\nI really like the different colour schemes of this theme. Enough choice between light and dark blends, but all of them have a very forgiving look that don't strain the eyes too much.\n\n## **2. [Horizon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode)**\n\nHorizon has six options to choose from, three light options and three dark options. My favourite is the Bright Bold one, because I like that contrast the best of all the light ones.\n\n![An image showing the Horizon Bright Bold theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/buw9oo7000h4gfax47g4.png)\n\n## **3. [FairyFloss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nopjmp.fairyfloss)**\n\nThe FairyFloss theme truly is one of my favourites of the bunch. Wonderful for those purple fans who like the highly saturated [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple) theme but want something a little more mellow.\n\n![An image showing the FairyFloss theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nytxwopueddx6y9vmfrn.png)\n\n## **4. [Soft Era](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=soft-aesthetic.soft-era-theme)**\n\nAre you willing to look at an almost white screen? Is that your thing? Then Soft Era must be the perfect theme for you. I have been using this theme mostly on days where I truly needed some more brightness in my life. But it has extremely low contrast so it is not highly productive for me.\n\n![An image showing the Soft Era theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2iqv8bb69roaf3fza0t6.png)\n\n## **5. [Pink Cat Boo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ftsamoyed.theme-pink-cat-boo)**\n\nPink Cat Boo is a very soft pink/maroon dark theme for those who are searching for more rose like colours in their coding life. The theme description describes it as being perfect for 'coder girls' but let's be honest, anyone can rock this theme if they feel like it ❤️.\n\n![An image showing the Pink Cat Boo theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4idq8mlyvrer3bl7vku4.png)\n\n## **6. [Pastel-Pixels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quangogage.pastel-pixels)**\n\nI mostly like the editor colours of this theme, but the sidebar and tab colours are a bit much for me for everyday use. But for those who don't care, maybe an awesome look for your editor!\n\n![An image showing the Pastel-Pixels theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zsntl0cqajthh44tl2wm.png)\n\n## **7. [Panda Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)**\n\nThis has been my go-to dark theme for a year now. It has soft yet good-contrast colours and I have had many colleagues ask me which one it is.\n\n![An image showing the Panda Syntax theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zpyb8cgvy5jfbi7326k2.png)\n\n## **8. [Bear](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dahong.theme-bear)**\n\nBear is a single option dark theme with fall colours that are easy on the eyes.\n\n![An image showing the Bear theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r8rx5fslqksnheveo8tz.png)\n\nHopefully this list might help you through the seasonal changes a bit more.
