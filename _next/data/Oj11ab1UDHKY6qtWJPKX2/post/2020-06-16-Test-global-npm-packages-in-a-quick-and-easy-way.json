You want to make changes in your component library and test them out in your React app without first having to deploy the entire package right? Let’s talk about how you can actually do this. Please don’t forget: the React app and component library are examples. You can do this with any project.\n\n### 1. Making your package available\n\nFirst we need to make the package (in our example a component library) available in your local system by going into its folder using your terminal and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link\n\n# npm\nnpm link\n```\n\n**What does this do?**\n\nThis command creates a symlink to our package in a specific location. You can see them in the location by going to the location:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\ncd ~/.config/yarn/link\n\n# npm\n# first figure out where your npm packages are saved by running\n\nnpm config ls -l\n\n# find the ‘prefix’ key\n# you can find where your packages are saved in\n\ncd {prefix}/lib/node_modules\n```\n\nThen run `ls` to see a list of all the packages that are installed.\n\n> **You keep talking about symlinks. What are those?**\n> A symlink (or ‘symbolic link’) is a file that has a reference to another file. You can also explain it as being a file that points to another file, or you can see it as a ‘shortcut’ on your computer.\n>\n> When you create a symlink you are telling your computer to create a link to file A. This link is saved in file B. When we want to use file B, we are essentially using file A.\n\n### 2. Linking to your package\n\nWe now go to the project where you want to use the package (in our example the React app). In here we run\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link <package name>\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nyarn link “catpaws”\n\n# npm\nnpm link <package name>\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nnpm link “catpaws”\n```\n\nAwesome.\n\nYour project now has its package linked locally so you can test everything out. Are you done testing? Then make sure to unlink the package in your project folder by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink <package name>\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink <package name>\n```\n\nAnd remove the package from the symlinks list by going to the folder of your package and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink\n```\n\n## How to link to your package globally?\n\nSo it’s all great to know how to create local links between projects, but how about when you don’t have a project, but your computer that needs to globally link to your local package? Well, it’s actually a bit different, but still super easy. First, let’s check which packages you already have installed globally by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn global list\n\n# yarn\nnpm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true\n```\n\nYou should get a nice overview of stuff that is already installed.\n\n### 1. Link to your package.\n\n**yarn**\nIn your terminal, run `yarn global add /full/path/to/package`.\nIf we now run `yarn global list` again, we should see the name of our package in the list.\n\nIf you want to remove it you simply run `yarn global remove “package name”`.\n\nNow there is a tricky part here. Yarn does not fully seem to support globally linking to local packages yet so the way we do this is actually a bit hacky. You see, yarn does not automatically update the package you have added, so for each change you want to test, you have to add it again...\n\nIt's easier with npm:\n\n**npm**\nWith npm it it the same as before, but we just go to the folder of our package and run `npm link`.\n\nIf you now run `npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true` you’ll see that your package is in the list.\n\nYou remove it from the list by going into the package folder and running `npm unlink`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing either yarn or npm, once you know how, it can be easy to create symlinks to test any package between projects, or in global mode. Right now, npm seems to have the easiest workflow.\n\nI got stuck the first time I had to develop something that I wanted to test globally and it took me some time to figure out how to make this work. I hope this helps others who might encounter the same problem. If you have any other way to do this please share them in the comments so we can all learn from it 👍.\n","date":["2020-06-16"],"slug":"Test-global-npm-packages-in-a-quick-and-easy-way","image":"https://velvety-tartufo-f1de54.netlify.app/_next/static/chunks/images/2020-06-16-7b76f14b67656058487186e5a204b7e3.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
