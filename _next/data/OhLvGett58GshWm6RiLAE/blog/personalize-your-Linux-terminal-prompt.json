No worries, there is hope!"},"markdownBody":"\nIn this blog, I'll explain how you can change the terminal's prompt to look just the way you want to.\n\n## What is the PS1 variable?\n\nWhen looking at our terminal we can see the command prompt. Depending on your system it will have some information in there. In the case of a standard Raspberry Pi it might look something like this:\n\n```bash\npi@raspberrypi:~ $\n```\n\nThe part `pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ` is actually a shell variable called `PS1`. There are actually five of these variables. `PS0`, `PS1`, `PS2`, `PS3`, `PS4`. Each of them is set up in a different way. To find out more about these variables you can look it up in _the manual_ ðŸ“– (`$ man bash`) underneath `Shell Variables`.\n\n## How is PS1 set up?\n\nWe can see how the variable is set up by typing\n\n```bash\n$ echo $PS1\n```\nThis will return `\\\\u@\\\\h:\\\\W\\\\a\\\\] $` in our example. The characters here actually represent a few things.\n\nThe `PS1` variable in our example consists of:\n\n* **\\\\u = pi** - the username\n* **@** - the character `@`\n* **\\\\h = raspberrypi** - the hostname\n* **:** - the character `:`\n* **\\\\W = ~~** - the current working directory\n* **\\\\a]** - an ASCII bell character\n* ** $** - a space and the `$` character\n\nThere are many of these characters that you can use. It's easy to find them by opening the bash manual (`man bash`) and searching for `PROMPTING`. It will give you a list of available backslash-escaped special characters.\n\nWe can change this variable very easily. Let's set it up to only show the username and current working directory:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\u [\\\\w]: \\\"\n```\n\n## Using colors\n\nWe can also use different colors in our Prompt. To check out what options we have, we can find them using `man terminal colors`. You'll find a list of available colors there:\n\n```\n0 to restore default color\n\n1 for brighter colors\n4 for underlined text\n5 for flashing text\n30 for black foreground\n31 for red foreground\n32 for green foreground\n33 for yellow (or brown) foreground\n34 for blue foreground\n35 for purple foreground\n36 for cyan foreground\n37 for white (or gray) foreground\n40 for black background\n41 for red background\n42 for green background\n43 for yellow (or brown) background\n44 for blue background\n45 for purple background\n46 for cyan background\n47 for white (or gray) background\n```\n\nWe can set a foreground and background color for our prompt. For example, let's turn the background purple and the foreground a white color.\n\nInside your terminal type:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\e[45;37m\\\\ \\\\u [\\\\w]:\\\\e[0m \\\"\n```\n\nLet's look at the first part `\\\\e[45;37m`.\n* `\\\\e[` tells bash that we are giving new color information\n* `45` the background color purple\n* `;` just a separation between the colors\n* `37` the foreground color white\n* `m` indicates the end of the color definitions\n\nKnowing this, we can also see that the end part `\\\\e[0m ` resets everything back to default. To see what happens if we keep this out, try setting it without the end part.\n\nNow for the last personalization...\n\n## Using special characters\n\nLet's spice it up a bit more by adding a few more bits and bobs. (Get it? bits? No? Alrighty...).\n\nI want to use a few special characters to give a fading look, `â–“`, `â–’` and `â–‘`. In order to include these in the `PS1` variable, we're going to need their octal numbers. I used [Graphemica.com](http://graphemica.com/unicode/characters) to find the octal numbers.\n\n* â–“ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223`\n* â–’ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222`\n* â–‘ = `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221`\n\nWhen we want to put them together we just chain the numbers: `\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221`. We also want to set the right colors. So we'll turn the foreground color purple and the background color back to default by adding `\\\\e[0;35m`. We add this right after the working directory character as such:\n\n```\n$ PS1=\\\"\\\\e[45;37m \\\\u [\\\\w]\\\\e[0;35m\\\\342\\\\226\\\\223\\\\342\\\\226\\\\222\\\\342\\\\226\\\\221:\\\\e[0m \\\"\n```\nThis will set up us with something looking like this:\n\n![The end result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1ihzx5aquvinnreuo2xa.png)\n\nOf course, there are other creative things you can do and other characters you can use.\n\n## Setting it in your bash files\n\nNow that we have something fun set up, let's make sure it is permanent. You can do this by setting this variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\n\n```\nPS1=\"\\e[45;37m \\u [\\w]\\e[0;35m\\342\\226\\223\\342\\226\\222\\342\\226\\221:\\e[0m\"\n```\n\nAnd that's it! This way, your prompt will look this way, even if you restart your computer.\n\nI'm really curious about other awesome ways there are to personalize the terminal. And also to see what types of combinations people can come up with to personalize their prompt, so please share your creations!\n","date":"February 17, 2020","slug":"personalize-your-Linux-terminal-prompt","image":null},"__N_SSG":true}
