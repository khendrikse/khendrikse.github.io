It's hard for us humans to achieve the same comfort. But having your Vim scheme set up properly to give you a relaxed vibe might just be the next best thing. If you are looking for some cute, cozy, fluffy and pastel color schemes for Vim, you've come to the right place. Here are 9 highly curated schemes just for you.","cover_image":"2021-08-17.jpg","cover_image_alt":"a white cat napping","markdownBody":"\nPhoto by [Joyful](https://unsplash.com/@joyfulcaptures?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n\n### [1989](https://github.com/sonjapeterson/1989.vim)\n\nIf you are a big Taylor Swift fan... Well then don't look any longer! Here she is! This Taylor Swift themed color scheme [1989](https://github.com/sonjapeterson/1989.vim) is cute... it's pastel... there are gorgeous pinks, purples and yellows on a soft grey background. I'd say: It takes this way too far, and it'll leave you breathless.\n\n![example of the 1989 vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-1989.png)\n\n### [Cosme](https://github.com/beikome/cosme.vim)\n\nI know. You must think \"isn't this the same as 1989?\". No, it's called [Cosme](https://github.com/beikome/cosme.vim)! It is SO MUCH like the 1989 theme (a little less cute tbh) but wait... There is more. Because have you seen that gorgeous vim-airline theme it has going on at the bottom? Yes! Hear me out: like 1989 better than Cosme? Why not combine that beauty with the cosme airline theme. Yes. You're welcome.\n\n![example of the Cosme vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-cosme.png)\n\n### [Alabaster](https://github.com/agudulin/vim-colors-alabaster)\n\nIf you are going for minimalism and the only reason you are not working full black and white is because that is too boring for you and is simply one bridge too far. This is perfect for you! [Alabaster](https://github.com/agudulin/vim-colors-alabaster) is a super minimalistic scheme. Black text on a white background, with some sprinkles of pastel greens, purply pinks, yellows and blues. It especially thrives on a split terminal screen as seen with this example of NERDtree.\n\n![example of the Alabaster vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-alabaster.png)\n\n### [Dogrun](https://github.com/wadackel/vim-dogrun)\n\n[Dogrun](https://github.com/wadackel/vim-dogrun) is as if a pastel puppy was (safely) put in the washer and dryer a bunch of times\\* and its cute coat just became fluffier and fluffier but also kind of toned down a bit. You get what I'm saying? I'm talking toned down red, light purple and some greens. It's darker for those that like it but I think it still has that cozy vibe to it.\n\n\\*Don't ever do this. This would not be okay. I'm scared writing this.\n![example of the Dogrun vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-dogrun.png)\n\n### [Espresso](https://github.com/gmoe/vim-espresso)\n\nCan you already smell [Espresso](https://github.com/gmoe/vim-espresso)? It has a dark grey background for some bitterness. The green and blue add some fresh acidity and last but not least some popping pink that brings just the right sweetness to it. Bitter, acidic and sweet. Need I say more?\n\n![example of the Espresso vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-espresso.png)\n\n### [Soft Era](https://github.com/soft-aesthetic/soft-era-vim)\n\nNow... Having the intense urge of sprucing up your coding experience with pastel colors that make you feel homely, cozy, relaxed and vibing does not mean that it's going to make for the most readable code. [Soft Era](https://github.com/soft-aesthetic/soft-era-vim) is a classic when it comes to smooth color vibes. It's just not that readable. Still cute though!\n\n![example of the Soft Era vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-soft-era.png)\n\n### [FairyFloss](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/)\n\nThose who love the pastel vibes in coding are probably already familiar with Amy Wibowo and her dreamy [FairyFloss](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/) theme. Thankfully [FairyFloss](https://github.com/tssm/fairyfloss.vim) has been made available for Vim lovers too. The colors are mystical and dreamy with an actual okay amount of contrast. A classic that cannot be left out.\n\n![example of the fairy-floss vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-fairy-floss.png)\n\n### [Panda Syntax](https://github.com/markvincze/panda-vim)\n\nLike mentioned before, pastel colors are not always the best when it comes to readability. This is why I've stuck with [Panda Syntax](https://github.com/markvincze/panda-vim) for such a long time. Even though it's not very pastel, I still think it's very cute. As a little extra, I would recommend having this tasty scheme together with the [Fruit Punch Airline Theme](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/fruit_punch.vim).\n\n![example of the Panda Syntax vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-panda.png)\n\n\n### [Tsen Magenta Yellow](https://github.com/marreman/tsen-magenta-yellow)\n\nSomething about the purple inspired [Tsen Magenta Yellow](https://github.com/marreman/tsen-magenta-yellow) calms me so much. Even though it is simple, I love the yellow notes that it brings. I could say more but I'll just let you rest and have a moment of calmth to process these blissful colors.\n\n![example of the Tsen Magenta Yellow vim colorscheme](vim-color-schemes/t-tsen-magenta-yellow.png)\n\nMost pastel/purple/pink themes or color schemes are really low contrast. They are therefore [not very accessible](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2015-01-05-what-is-color-contrast/) to everyone. Of course it still depends on the individual, but I did do a quick check. And the following should be somewhat compliant to the [WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html):\n- 1989\n- Cosme\n- Alabaster\n- Tsen Magento Yellow (almost)\n","slug":"9-cozy-vim-color-schemes"},{"layout":"post","title":"Awesome soft, airy and fluffy VSC themes","published":true,"oldBlog":true,"date":"2019-09-17","description":"These themes will lift you off for cozy coding.","tags":"curated-color-schemes","intro":"When coding I sometimes feel the need to change the aesthetics of my workspace. Why? I don't know. Maybe because it gives me a fresh look at my code. Maybe because with the seasons changing, I feel the need to lighten or darken my workspace colours. Either way, for those searching for something airy and new. Here is a list of wonderful Visual Studio Code themes that have a cozy, soft or fluffy aesthetic.","markdownBody":"\n## **1. [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)**\nNoctis is a collection of light & dark themes that have soft blends of colours with enough choice of different contrasts.\n\n![An image showing the Noctis Lilac theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q17vuc93wq2sdk64tal0.png)\n\nI really like the different colour schemes of this theme. Enough choice between light and dark blends, but all of them have a very forgiving look that don't strain the eyes too much.\n\n## **2. [Horizon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode)**\n\nHorizon has six options to choose from, three light options and three dark options. My favourite is the Bright Bold one, because I like that contrast the best of all the light ones.\n\n![An image showing the Horizon Bright Bold theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/buw9oo7000h4gfax47g4.png)\n\n## **3. [FairyFloss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nopjmp.fairyfloss)**\n\nThe FairyFloss theme truly is one of my favourites of the bunch. Wonderful for those purple fans who like the highly saturated [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple) theme but want something a little more mellow.\n\n![An image showing the FairyFloss theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nytxwopueddx6y9vmfrn.png)\n\n## **4. [Soft Era](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=soft-aesthetic.soft-era-theme)**\n\nAre you willing to look at an almost white screen? Is that your thing? Then Soft Era must be the perfect theme for you. I have been using this theme mostly on days where I truly needed some more brightness in my life. But it has extremely low contrast so it is not highly productive for me.\n\n![An image showing the Soft Era theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2iqv8bb69roaf3fza0t6.png)\n\n## **5. [Pink Cat Boo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ftsamoyed.theme-pink-cat-boo)**\n\nPink Cat Boo is a very soft pink/maroon dark theme for those who are searching for more rose like colours in their coding life. The theme description describes it as being perfect for 'coder girls' but let's be honest, anyone can rock this theme if they feel like it ❤️.\n\n![An image showing the Pink Cat Boo theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4idq8mlyvrer3bl7vku4.png)\n\n## **6. [Pastel-Pixels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quangogage.pastel-pixels)**\n\nI mostly like the editor colours of this theme, but the sidebar and tab colours are a bit much for me for everyday use. But for those who don't care, maybe an awesome look for your editor!\n\n![An image showing the Pastel-Pixels theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zsntl0cqajthh44tl2wm.png)\n\n## **7. [Panda Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)**\n\nThis has been my go-to dark theme for a year now. It has soft yet good-contrast colours and I have had many colleagues ask me which one it is.\n\n![An image showing the Panda Syntax theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zpyb8cgvy5jfbi7326k2.png)\n\n## **8. [Bear](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dahong.theme-bear)**\n\nBear is a single option dark theme with fall colours that are easy on the eyes.\n\n![An image showing the Bear theme](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r8rx5fslqksnheveo8tz.png)\n\nHopefully this list might help you through the seasonal changes a bit more.
