But how do you do this? Here’s an easy guide on achieving a link to a local project to test out globally in your command line using either yarn or npm.","tags":"beginner, javascript, npm, yarn","cover_image":"2020-06-16.png","cover_image_alt":"illustration of chains","markdownBody":"\n## How do you link projects?\n\nLet’s say you are working on a React app and you have another project, like a component library, that you are also working on at the same time. You want to make changes in your component library and test them out in your React app without first having to deploy the entire package right? Let’s talk about how you can actually do this. Please don’t forget: the React app and component library are examples. You can do this with any project.\n\n### 1. Making your package available\n\nFirst we need to make the package (in our example a component library) available in your local system by going into its folder using your terminal and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link\n\n# npm\nnpm link\n```\n\n\n**What does this do?**\n\nThis command creates a symlink to our package in a specific location. You can see them in the location by going to the location:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\ncd ~/.config/yarn/link\n\n# npm\n# first figure out where your npm packages are saved by running\n\nnpm config ls -l\n\n# find the ‘prefix’ key\n# you can find where your packages are saved in\n\ncd {prefix}/lib/node_modules\n```\n\nThen run `ls` to see a list of all the packages that are installed.\n\n\n> **You keep talking about symlinks. What are those?**\n> A symlink (or ‘symbolic link’) is a file that has a reference to another file. You can also explain it as being a file that points to another file, or you can see it as a ‘shortcut’ on your computer.\n>\n>When you create a symlink you are telling your computer to create a link to file A. This link is saved in file B. When we want to use file B, we are essentially using file A.\n\n### 2. Linking to your package\n\nWe now go to the project where you want to use the package (in our example the React app). In here we run\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn link <package name>\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nyarn link “catpaws”\n\n# npm\nnpm link <package name>\n\n# So, let’s say that your package’s name is ‘catpaws’ you will do\nnpm link “catpaws”\n```\n\nAwesome.\n\nYour project now has its package linked locally so you can test everything out. Are you done testing? Then make sure to unlink the package in your project folder by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink <package name>\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink <package name>\n```\n\nAnd remove the package from the symlinks list by going to the folder of your package and running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn unlink\n\n# npm\nnpm unlink\n```\n\n\n## How to link to your package globally?\n\nSo it’s all great to know how to create local links between projects, but how about when you don’t have a project, but your computer that needs to globally link to your local package? Well, it’s actually a bit different, but still super easy. First, let’s check which packages you already have installed globally by running:\n\n```shell\n# yarn\nyarn global list\n\n# yarn\nnpm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true\n```\n\nYou should get a nice overview of stuff that is already installed.\n\n### 1. Link to your package.\n\n**yarn**\nIn your terminal, run `yarn global add /full/path/to/package`.\nIf we now run `yarn global list` again, we should see the name of our package in the list.\n\nIf you want to remove it you simply run `yarn global remove “package name”`.\n\nNow there is a tricky part here. Yarn does not fully seem to support globally linking to local packages yet so the way we do this is actually a bit hacky. You see, yarn does not automatically update the package you have added, so for each change you want to test, you have to add it again...\n\nIt's easier with npm:\n\n**npm**\nWith npm it it the same as before, but we just go to the folder of our package and run `npm link`.\n\nIf you now run `npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true` you’ll see that your package is in the list.\n\nYou remove it from the list by going into the package folder and running `npm unlink`.\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing either yarn or npm, once you know how, it can be easy to create symlinks to test any package between projects, or in global mode. Right now, npm seems to have the easiest workflow.\n\nI got stuck the first time I had to develop something that I wanted to test globally and it took me some time to figure out how to make this work. I hope this helps others who might encounter the same problem. If you have any other way to do this please share them in the comments so we can all learn from it 👍.\n","slug":"Test-global-npm-packages-in-a-quick-and-easy-way"},{"layout":"post","title":"The basics of a function, illustrated! ✨","published":true,"oldBlog":true,"date":"2020-05-21","description":"Learn about JavaScript functions with a simple metaphor.","intro":"One thing that can be difficult to understand when you just start out learning how to program is what a function is and how it works. As a beginner developer, it can be especially difficult to understand what arguments are and where they come from. This blog illustrates how a  javascript function works in its most basic form.","tags":"beginner, javascript, codenewbie","cover_image":"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/tri97q55qgtexhhakgxe.png","cover_image_alt":"illustration of an abstract factory","markdownBody":"\n## What is a function\n\n*Functions are like small programs that are built to do a specific task.* We first create (or 'declare') this program (which we will from now on call a function). Once we are done writing it, we can start using (or 'execute') it.\n\nIt’s kind of like building a small factory. While setting up the factory we create a building. Inside this building, we set everything in place so the factory can receive whatever raw materials it needs and return whatever product we want as output.\n\nLet’s say we want to build a factory that takes any number and adds two. From the inside the factory would look something like this:\n\n![a factory that takes in a number and returns that number plus two](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9onjc8zt7vpuommno32w.png)\n\nWe can see that the factory is expecting to get any type of number as input. Because we don’t know yet which number it might receive, we’ll just call whatever input we get `num` for ‘number’. Inside the factory, we add 2 to whatever we got as input. It then returns the output which is the combination of `num + 2`.\n\n>### About `num`\n>`num` is just a representation, or container, for what we get as input. We can even rename it into whatever we want. If we were making a factory that added two apples to a number of bananas, we could rename `num` to `bananas`. The input would be a number of bananas, the output would be a number of bananas plus two apples.\n\nDo you see that we also gave the factory a name? `plusTwo`. This makes it a bit easier for when we want to refer to the factory. This way we can tell our workers: ‘I want you to use the factory `plusTwo` to process a specific number and add 2’.\n\nOur factory is ready to be used now. To use it we need to provide a number as input. Let’s say we want to give it a `3` as input. We can’t see what is happening inside the factory but we can see what is returned from the factory: it’s a 5 (3 + 2 = 5):\n\n![The outside of a factory that takes in 3 and returns 5](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o65pxtvzpgwjbkccobaa.png)\n\n## Let’s get coding\n\nFunctions essentially work the same way. Instead of building an imaginary factory, let’s actually start creating a function in JavaScript.\n\nWe first set up the function, these are like the walls of the factory. For convenience, we will also give the function a name, just like we did with the factory. We’ll call it `plusTwo`.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo( ) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe are then going to define what we are expecting the program to get as input. We call these `arguments` or `parameters`. In this case, we are expecting to get one number. And because it can be any type of number, we’re going to give it a more generic name like `num`. We will define this argument within the two parentheses `()`. Look at it as the door that allows our input arguments to enter the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWe’ll now finish the function by saying exactly what it needs to do and return. It needs to return the sum of `num` and 2. This will become the output of the function.\n\n```js\n\nfunction plusTwo(num) {\n    return num + 2;\n}\n\n```\n\nNow the function is ready to be used. It knows what it is going to get as input, and what it needs to return as output. The part where we use the word `return` is actually really important. This tells the function to `return` our output.\n\nOtherwise, it is kind of like closing the output door to our factory: the produced results cannot leave the factory:\n\n![The factory output door is closed and none of the product can get out](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/b77bysgp94758d7vx8ul.png)\n\n>### Again, what is `num`?\n>We can rename `num` into whatever we like. It is just a name that we make up to define whatever enters our function. For example, the following two functions would have the exact same result:\n\n```js\nfunction plusTwo(x) {\n    return x + 2;\n}\n\nfunction plusTwoApples(numberOfApples) {\n    return numberOfApples + 2;\n}\n```\n\n>`x` and `numberOfApples` are simply names we give whatever arguments we are going to get. While we could use `x` as a name for our arguments, it does not tell us a lot about what we are getting. This is why we try to give it a more descriptive name.\n\nFrom now on, if you want to code along, you can actually [open developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on this page and first type the function that we made just now, press return on your keyboard, and follow along for the next part.\n\n## Start using the function\n\nWe can now actually start using the function. Remember that we gave both the factory and the function a name? Just like with the factory, we can now tell our workers (in this case, our program) to use the function `plusTwo` to process a number and add 2’.\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(3) // returns 5\n\n```\n\nWe pass the number 3 into the doors that are our parentheses. In the function, this means that `num` now is a representation of 3. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 3.\n\nIf we pass 5, it will return 7:\n\n```js\n\nplusTwo(5) // returns 7\n\n```\n\nAgain, in our function `num` now is a representation of 5. In our factory drawings you imagine `num` to be 5.\n\nAnd that’s it! There is a lot more to learn about functions, but these are the basics that should help you get on your way! I hope it helps anyone learning this for the first time to understand the concepts a bit more.\n\n\n\n","slug":"The-basics-of-a-function-illustrated"}],"currentCategory":"javascript"},"__N_SSG":true}
