## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I am a JavaScript Developer from The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± with a background in communication, photography and design. I spend my workdays happily coding. During my free time I expand my knowledge, tinker on projects in software and sometimes hardware and enjoy myself with friends, games and plants ðŸŒ±.

## Fun
In my spare time I have created a few fun side projects like:

* [Streamkiwi](https://streamkiwi.app/) - A way to get an overview of all the people you are following on Twitch, and when they were going to stream next.
* [WhatGenre](https://whatgenre.herokuapp.com/) - Using Spotify's API it checks what genre a given artist has.
* [PastelDeck](https://khendrikse.github.io/pasteldeck/) - A cute slideshow generator. 
* [Spotify to Slack](https://github.com/khendrikse/spotify-to-slack) - Inspired by msn statusses from back in the day. You can run it locally to sync the song you're listening to on Spotify with your Slack status.
* [Oob-this](https://oob-this.netlify.com/) -A small website that replaces each vowel in a word with 'oob'. 

## Tech
I use JavaScript and ReactJS on a day-to-day basis. Doing this I have gained experience with Gatsby, Nextjs, Nodejs, using a Headless CMS and doing Content modelling and a bunch of other things that I have forgotten right nowâœ¨.

I enjoy learning more about developer experience, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. I really like finding ways to increase productivity while creating better quality code. 

## Community
RailsGirls was the start of my journey to becoming a software engineer. Experiencing that group of open-minded people has really motivated me to contribute to the developer community. This is why I try to be involved in helping out with RailsGirls NL and why I am a guild leader at YoungCapital. It brings me great joy to help unite fellow developers.
