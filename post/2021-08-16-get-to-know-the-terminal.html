An interface can be between hardware and software, but also between computer and human. Your operating system gives you multiple interfaces to interact with it.

Both are text based ways to help you navigate and interact with your operating system. But what is actually the difference between the terminal, command line and shell?\n\n## Terminology\n\n### Interface\n\nA way for things to exchange information. An interface can be between hardware and software, but also between computer and human. Your operating system gives you multiple interfaces to interact with it. One of them you are probably using right now: a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This is everything you see on your screen.

These words together form a command. In the rest of this article I'll refer to this as 'a command'.\n\n### Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\nNotice the word _interface_? The Command Line Interface, or CLI, is an _interface_ where we can enter our _command lines_. Once we have entered our command, we press the return key to input it into our CLI.\n\n### Interpreter\n\nAn interpreter is like a translator. Computers speak a different language than we do. This is why an interpreter translates commands, and passes them on to the computer in a language the computer can understand.\n\n### Shell\n\nThe shell is one of those _interpreters_. It translates the command you entered through the CLI into something the computer understands. There are different types of shells. Some examples are zsh, bash or cmd.exe. We will go into that a bit later on. For now, just remember they help translate our commands into computer-readable language.\n\n### Terminal\n\nThe terminal is an environment that runs (or executes, or in other words: uses) the shell.

We open the terminal on our computer, type into the CLI that is part of the terminal and once we press the return key it sends the command to the shell so it can interpret it and tell the computer what we want it to do.\n\n## Different terminal emulators and shells\n\nThere are a bunch of different terminal emulators.
