So my colleague and me started preparing a 1,5 hour workshop with the goal of showing the kids how much fun programming could be. This is the story of how it went.</div><h2>Get to know what they love</h2><p>Our goal was to stay as close to their own interests as possible. So with a little bit of research we discovered that these kids really loved to use mobile phones and consoles outside of school.

We wanted to switch between our (giphy-filled) slides and the Kahoot to ask them a few questions now and then about what we were talking about. When we actually had the lesson we decided to first just do all of the questions with Kahoot, talk a little about the answers and then dive deeper into them after the quiz.

We let them do a short &#x27;hacking&#x27; exercise. On their laptops they got to go to their favourite website. Which, for most was YouTube or a popular news website as that is where we showed an example. Then by using <code>inspect</code> in the browser, we let them change the text of a video title or news article.
