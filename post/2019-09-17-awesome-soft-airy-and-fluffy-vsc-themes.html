Why? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe because it gives me a fresh look at my code. Maybe because with the seasons changing, I feel the need to lighten or darken my workspace colours. Either way, for those searching for something airy and new. Here is a list of wonderful Visual Studio Code themes that have a cozy, soft or fluffy aesthetic.</div><h2><strong>1. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis">Noctis</a></strong></h2><p>Noctis is a collection of light &amp; dark themes that have soft blends of colours with enough choice of different contrasts.</p><p><img alt="An image showing the Noctis Lilac theme" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q17vuc93wq2sdk64tal0.png?lqip" style="transition:0.2s filter linear;filter:blur(20px)"/></p><p>I really like the different colour schemes of this theme. Enough choice between light and dark blends, but all of them have a very forgiving look that don&#x27;t strain the eyes too much.</p><h2><strong>2. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode">Horizon</a></strong></h2><p>Horizon has six options to choose from, three light options and three dark options.

Wonderful for those purple fans who like the highly saturated <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple">Shades of Purple</a> theme but want something a little more mellow.</p><p><img alt="An image showing the FairyFloss theme" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nytxwopueddx6y9vmfrn.png?lqip" style="transition:0.2s filter linear;filter:blur(20px)"/></p><h2><strong>4. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=soft-aesthetic.soft-era-theme">Soft Era</a></strong></h2><p>Are you willing to look at an almost white screen? Is that your thing? Then Soft Era must be the perfect theme for you. I have been using this theme mostly on days where I truly needed some more brightness in my life. But it has extremely low contrast so it is not highly productive for me.</p><p><img alt="An image showing the Soft Era theme" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2iqv8bb69roaf3fza0t6.png?lqip" style="transition:0.2s filter linear;filter:blur(20px)"/></p><h2><strong>5. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ftsamoyed.theme-pink-cat-boo">Pink Cat Boo</a></strong></h2><p>Pink Cat Boo is a very soft pink/maroon dark theme for those who are searching for more rose like colours in their coding life. The theme description describes it as being perfect for &#x27;coder girls&#x27; but let&#x27;s be honest, anyone can rock this theme if they feel like it ❤️.</p><p><img alt="An image showing the Pink Cat Boo theme" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4idq8mlyvrer3bl7vku4.png?lqip" style="transition:0.2s filter linear;filter:blur(20px)"/></p><h2><strong>6. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quangogage.pastel-pixels">Pastel-Pixels</a></strong></h2><p>I mostly like the editor colours of this theme, but the sidebar and tab colours are a bit much for me for everyday use. But for those who don&#x27;t care, maybe an awesome look for your editor!</p><p><img alt="An image showing the Pastel-Pixels theme" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zsntl0cqajthh44tl2wm.png?lqip" style="transition:0.2s filter linear;filter:blur(20px)"/></p><h2><strong>7. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda">Panda Syntax</a></strong></h2><p>This has been my go-to dark theme for a year now.
