            I'm a front-end software engineer from The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± with a
            background in communication, photography and design. I spend my
            workdays happily coding at
            <a href='http://www.youngcapital.nl'>YoungCapital</a>. During my
            free time I expand my knowledge, tinker on projects in software and
            sometimes hardware and enjoy myself with friends, games and plants
            ðŸŒ±.
          </strong>

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <p>
          I use JavaScript and ReactJS on a day-to-day basis. Lately I have been
          diving into the developer experience by learning more about Continuous
          Integration and Continuous Deployment. I really like finding ways to
          increase productivity while creating better quality code.
        </p>

        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
          RailsGirls was the start of my journey to becoming a software
          engineer. Experiencing that group of open-minded people has really
          motivated me to contribute to the developer community. It's why I try
          to be involved in helping out with RailsGirls NL and why I am a
          front-end guild leader at YoungCapital. It brings me great joy to help
          unite fellow developers.
