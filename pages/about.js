            I am a Full-Stack Developer from The Netherlands with a background
            in communication, photography and design. Eager to learn, I spend my
            workdays coding in JavaScript, Node.js, React, and of course HTML
            and CSS. During my free time I like to learn more, tinker on
            projects and enjoy myself with friends, creative projects, games and
            plants. ðŸŒ±.
          </strong>

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <p>
          I use JavaScript and ReactJS on a day-to-day basis. Lately I have been
          diving into the developer experience by learning more about Continuous
          Integration and Continuous Deployment. I really like finding ways to
          increase productivity while creating better quality code.
        </p>

        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
          RailsGirls was the start of my journey to becoming a software
          engineer. Experiencing that group of open-minded people has really
          motivated me to contribute to the developer community. This is why I
          try to be involved in helping out with RailsGirls NL and why I am a
          front-end guild leader at YoungCapital. It brings me great joy to help
          unite fellow developers.
