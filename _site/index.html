    You might already be used to creating symlinks between projects locally using yarn or npm. But what if you are  working on a cli package that you want the user to use globally? You also want to be able to test your package locally to make sure everything is working as it should. But how do you do this? Here’s an easy guide on achieving a link to a local project to test out globally in your command line using either yarn or npm.

    One thing that can be difficult to understand when you just start out learning how to program is what a function is and how it works. As a beginner developer, it can be especially difficult to understand what arguments are and where they come from. This blog illustrates how a  javascript function works in its most basic form.

    Enough developers out there deliver great day-to-day work without having to touch bash whatsoever. Yet, every now and then we all encounter a piece of bash script, be it from a colleague or copied from a Stack Overflow post. Yeah, the script works, but do we understand what is happening? I wanted to know myself so I started small. Let's dive into redirection.

    If you're just as much of a fan of personalizing your coding environment as I am, you must have been just as bummed out when you ran your Linux environment without a GUI and found out there was no real 'theming' going on in your terminal. No worries, there is hope!

    In the last post we set up a small script to light up the Blinkt with beautiful purple-blue lights. In this post we're going to automatically run a script when we turn the Pi on and stop and clear the LEDs when we turn it off.
